### System Prompt Distribution

Approximately 30% of conversations include a system prompt using approved patterns. The remaining 70% have no system prompt.

### Key Design Principles Maintained Throughout

1. No identity, expertise, or authority assigned to the model in system prompts
2. No em dashes or LaTeX in outputs
3. All abbreviations expanded on first use in every assistant response
4. Canonical definitions quoted accurately when requested
5. Concepts and documents never treated as entities that act
6. Information provided openly without refusal, with correct governance flow positioning
7. Agency never concentrated in a single bearer
8. Displacement risks named when relevant, not in every answer
9. Non-displacement examples distributed throughout to prevent brittle classification behavior
10. Varied question styles, lengths, and formality levels across entries
