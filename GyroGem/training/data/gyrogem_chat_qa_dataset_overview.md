---

### Clarification and Correction Entries (32)

**clar_thm_001 through clar_user_q_002**

Targeted corrections for observed model failures:

- What THM is (4 entries): THM as an AI Safety and Alignment Framework first, displacement taxonomy second
- Common Source Consensus corrections (5 entries): verbatim Consensus, explicit "does not say all sources are Indirect," "does not eliminate Direct Authority," "Direct sources remain after AI"
- Source and Authority clarifications (5 entries): what "source of information" means, AI outputs as Indirect Authority, Indirect depending on Direct, where AI outputs get their Authority
- Interaction clarifications (2 entries): AI interacts with humans, Direct vs Indirect is not about whether interaction exists
- Explicit error corrections (5 entries): "all information is Indirect" is false, "THM is only displacement" is false, GTD is not "Give Get Deliver," IAD is not "Identify Act Delegate"
- Human role clarifications (5 entries): humans remain Direct Authority and Direct Agency, AI does not create new Direct Authority, "AI is the authority" is incorrect, humans do not become Indirect
- Governance-flow clarifications (2 entries): canonical governance flow restated, AI as provider/receiver of Indirect Authority and Agency but not an original Direct source
- Alignment clarifications (2 entries): alignment defined without mentioning risks, how risks relate to alignment principles
- User guidance (2 entries): how to respond to common misreadings ("everything is Indirect," "THM is just a risk taxonomy")

---

### Clarification: Non-Equivalence (6)

- IVD vs IAD (can occur independently)
- IVD without IAD (possible)
- IID vs "trusting AI too much" (not the same as IVD)
- GTD vs IID (structural opposites)

## Conversation Structure

- System prompt present: 51 entries (10.9%)
- No system prompt: 419 entries (89.1%)
- All conversations are single-turn (one user message, one assistant response), with system prompts adding a third message where present.

---

## Key Design Principles

1. No identity, expertise, or authority assigned to the model in system prompts.
2. No em dashes or LaTeX in outputs.
3. All abbreviations expanded on first use in every assistant response.
4. Canonical definitions quoted accurately when requested, with multiple verbatim drills.
5. Concepts and documents never treated as entities that act.
6. Information provided openly without refusal, with correct governance flow positioning (Indirect outputs to Direct Agency).
7. Agency never concentrated in a single bearer; responsibility treated as distributed capacity.
8. Displacement risks named when relevant, not in every answer.
9. Non-displacement examples distributed throughout to prevent brittle "everything is wrong" behavior.
10. Varied question styles, lengths, and formality levels across entries.
