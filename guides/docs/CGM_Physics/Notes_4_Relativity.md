'''Tests of general relativity''' serve to establish observational evidence for the [[theory of general relativity]]. The first three tests, proposed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1915, concerned the "anomalous" [[precession]] of the [[perihelion]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the bending of light in [[gravitational field]]s, and the [[gravitational redshift]]. The precession of Mercury was already known; experiments showing light bending in accordance with the predictions of [[general relativity]] were performed in 1919, with increasingly precise measurements made in subsequent tests; and scientists claimed to have measured the gravitational redshift in 1925, although measurements sensitive enough to actually confirm the theory were not made until 1954. A more accurate program starting in 1959 tested general relativity in the weak gravitational field limit, severely limiting possible deviations from the theory.

In the 1970s, scientists began to make additional tests, starting with [[Irwin I. Shapiro|Irwin Shapiro]]'s measurement of the relativistic time delay in radar signal travel time near the Sun. Beginning in 1974, [[Russell Alan Hulse|Hulse]], [[Joseph Hooton Taylor, Jr.|Taylor]] and others studied the behaviour of [[binary pulsar]]s experiencing much stronger gravitational fields than those found in the Solar System. Both in the weak field limit (as in the Solar System) and with the stronger fields present in systems of binary pulsars the predictions of general relativity have been extremely well tested.

In February 2016, the [[LIGO|Advanced LIGO]] team announced that they had [[Gravitational wave detection|directly detected gravitational waves]] from a black hole merger.<ref name="Discovery 2016"/> This discovery, along with additional detections announced in June 2016 and June 2017,<ref name="conover2017">Conover, Emily, [https://www.sciencenews.org/article/ligo-snags-another-set-gravitational-waves LIGO snags another set of gravitational waves], ''Science News'', June 1, 2017.

# the [[gravitational redshift]] of light

In the letter to ''[[The Times]]'' (of London) on November 28, 1919, he described the theory of relativity and thanked his English colleagues for their understanding and testing of his work. He also mentioned three classical tests with comments:<ref>{{cite web|title=What Is The Theory Of Relativity?|author=Einstein, Albert |year=1919|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/EDU_Einstein_ENGLISH.pdf|publisher=German History in Documents and Images|access-date=7 June 2013}}</ref>
: "The chief attraction of the theory lies in its logical completeness. If a single one of the conclusions drawn from it proves wrong, it must be given up; to modify it without destroying the whole structure seems to be impossible."

=== Perihelion precession of Mercury ===

[[File:Apsidendrehung.png|right|thumb|150px|The perihelion precession of Mercury]]

Under [[Newtonian physics]], an object in an (isolated) two-body system, consisting of the object orbiting a spherical mass, would trace out an [[ellipse]] with the center of mass of the system at a [[focus (geometry)|focus]] of the ellipse. The point of closest approach, called the [[periapsis]] (or when the central body is the Sun, [[perihelion]]), is fixed. Hence the major axis of the ellipse remains fixed in space. Both objects orbit around the center of mass of this system, so they each have their own ellipse. However, a number of effects in the Solar System cause the perihelia of planets to precess (rotate) around the Sun in the plane of their orbits, or equivalently, cause the major axis to rotate about the center of mass, hence changing its orientation in space.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Precession of Mercury's Perihelion|url=https://www.macmillanlearning.com/studentresources/college/physics/tiplermodernphysics6e/more_sections/more_chapter_2_1-perihelion_of_mercurys_orbit.pdf}}</ref> The principal cause is the presence of other planets which [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturb]] one another's orbit. Another (much less significant) effect is solar [[oblate spheroid|oblateness]].

[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] deviates from the precession predicted from these Newtonian effects. This anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit was first recognized in 1859 as a problem in [[celestial mechanics]], by [[Urbain Le Verrier]]. His re-analysis of available timed observations of transits of Mercury over the Sun's disk from 1697 to 1848 showed that the actual rate of the precession disagreed from that predicted from Newton's theory by 38″ ([[arcseconds]]) per [[tropical year|tropical century]] (later re-estimated at 43″ by [[Simon Newcomb]] in 1882).<ref name=Verrier1859/> A number of ''ad hoc'' and ultimately unsuccessful solutions were proposed, but they tended to introduce more problems. Le Verrier suggested that another hypothetical planet might exist to account for Mercury's behavior.<ref name=Verrier1859>{{cite journal |last1=Le Verrier |first1=U. |title=Lettre de M. Le Verrier à M.

Finally, in 1908, [[W. W. Campbell]], Director of the Lick Observatory, after the comprehensive photographic observations by Lick astronomer, [[Charles D. Perrine]], at three solar eclipse expeditions, stated, "In my opinion, Dr. Perrine's work at the three eclipses of 1901, 1905, and 1908 brings the observational side of the famous intramercurial-planet problem definitely to a close."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=W.

Einstein wrote to [[Michele Besso]], "Perihelion motions explained quantitatively&nbsp;... we will be astonished".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Baum |first1=Richard |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4899-6100-6 |title=In Search of Planet Vulcan: The Ghost in Newton's Clockwork Universe |last2=Sheehan |first2=William |date=1997 |publisher=Springer US |isbn=978-0-306-45567-4 |location=Boston, MA |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-6100-6}}</ref>

In general relativity, this remaining [[Stellar precession|precession]], or change of orientation of the orbital ellipse within its orbital plane, is explained by gravitation being mediated by the curvature of spacetime. Einstein showed that general relativity<ref name=Ein1916 /> agrees closely with the observed amount of perihelion shift. This was a powerful factor motivating the adoption of general relativity.

Although earlier measurements of planetary orbits were made using conventional telescopes, more accurate measurements are now made with [[Radar astronomy|radar]]. The total observed precession of Mercury is (574.10 ± 0.65)″ per century<ref name="Clemence">{{cite journal |first=G.

The other planets experience perihelion shifts as well, but, since they are farther from the Sun and have longer periods, their shifts are lower, and could not be observed accurately until long after Mercury's. For example, the perihelion shift of Earth's orbit due to general relativity is theoretically 3.83868″ per century and experimentally ({{val|3.8387|0.0004}})″/cy, Venus's is 8.62473″/cy and (8.6247 ± 0.0005)″/cy and Mars' is ({{val|1.351|0.001}})″/cy.

=== Deflection of light by the Sun ===
[[File:1919 eclipse negative.jpg|right|thumb|150px|One of [[Sir Arthur Eddington|Eddington]]'s photographs of the [[Eddington experiment|1919 solar eclipse experiment]], presented in his 1920 paper announcing its success]]

[[Henry Cavendish]] in 1784 (in an unpublished manuscript) and [[Johann Georg von Soldner]] in 1801 (published in 1804) had pointed out that Newtonian gravity predicts that starlight will bend around a massive object.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Soldner, J.

However, Einstein noted in 1915 in the process of completing general relativity, that his 1911 result (and thus Soldner's 1801 result) is only half of the correct value.

Einstein predicted the [[gravitational redshift]] of light from the [[equivalence principle]] in 1907, and it was predicted that this effect might be measured in the spectral lines of a [[white dwarf star]], which has a very high gravitational field. Initial attempts to measure the gravitational redshift of the spectrum of [[Sirius-B]] were done by [[Walter Sydney Adams]] in 1925, but the result was criticized as being unusable due to the contamination from light from the (much brighter) primary star, [[Sirius]].<ref name= "Hetherington1980">Hetherington, N.

=== Tests of special relativity ===
{{see also|Tests of special relativity}}

The general theory of relativity incorporates Einstein's [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]], and hence tests of special relativity are also testing aspects of general relativity. As a consequence of the [[equivalence principle]], [[Lorentz invariance]] holds locally in non-rotating, freely falling reference frames. Experiments related to Lorentz invariance special relativity (that is, when gravitational effects can be neglected) are described in [[tests of special relativity]].

== Modern tests ==

=== Post-Newtonian tests of gravity ===
Early tests of general relativity were hampered by the lack of viable competitors to the theory: it was not clear what sorts of tests would distinguish it from its competitors. General relativity was the only known relativistic theory of gravity compatible with special relativity and observations. This changed in 1960 with the introduction of [[Brans–Dicke theory]] which provided an alternative theory also in agreement with experimental observations.<ref name="Will">{{cite book

This approximation allows the possible deviations from general relativity, for slowly moving objects in weak gravitational fields, to be systematically analyzed. Much effort has been put into constraining the post-Newtonian parameters, and deviations from general relativity are at present severely limited.

The experiments testing gravitational lensing and light time delay limits the same post-Newtonian parameter, the so-called Eddington parameter γ, which is a straightforward parametrization of the amount of deflection of light by a gravitational source. It is equal to one for general relativity, and takes different values in other theories (such as Brans–Dicke theory). It is the best constrained of the ten post-Newtonian parameters, but there are other experiments designed to constrain the others. Precise observations of the perihelion shift of Mercury constrain other parameters, as do tests of the strong equivalence principle.

One of the goals of the [[BepiColombo]] mission to Mercury, is to test the general relativity theory by measuring the parameters gamma and beta of the parametrized post-Newtonian formalism with high accuracy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=47346 |title=Fact Sheet }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.66.082001 |volume=66 |title=Testing general relativity with the BepiColombo radio science experiment |year=2002 |journal=Physical Review D |last1=Milani |first1=Andrea |last2=Vokrouhlický |first2=David |last3=Villani |first3=Daniela |last4=Bonanno |first4=Claudio |last5=Rossi |first5=Alessandro |issue=8 |page=082001 |bibcode=2002PhRvD..66h2001M }}</ref> The experiment is part of the Mercury Orbiter Radio science Experiment (MORE).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schettino |first1=Giulia |last2=Tommei |first2=Giacomo |year=2016 |title=Testing General Relativity with the Radio Science Experiment of the BepiColombo mission to Mercury |journal=Universe |volume=2 |issue=3 |page=21 |doi=10.3390/universe2030021 |bibcode=2016Univ....2...21S |doi-access=free |hdl=11568/804045 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref>[http://hdl.handle.net/11568/880343 The Mercury Orbiter Radio Science Experiment (MORE) on board the ESA/JAXA BepiColombo MIssion to Mercury].

=== Gravitational lensing ===
One of the most important tests is [[gravitational lensing]]. It has been observed in distant astrophysical sources, but these are poorly controlled and it is uncertain how they constrain general relativity. The most precise tests are analogous to Eddington's 1919 experiment: they measure the deflection of radiation from a distant source by the Sun. The sources that can be most precisely analyzed are distant [[radio astronomy|radio sources]]. In particular, some [[quasar]]s are very strong radio sources. The directional resolution of any telescope is in principle limited by diffraction; for radio telescopes this is also the practical limit. An important improvement in obtaining positional high accuracies (from milli-arcsecond to micro-arcsecond) was obtained by combining radio telescopes across Earth. The technique is called [[VLBI|very long baseline interferometry]] (VLBI). With this technique radio observations couple the phase information of the radio signal observed in telescopes separated over large distances. Recently, these telescopes have measured the deflection of radio waves by the Sun to extremely high precision, confirming the amount of deflection predicted by general relativity aspect to the 0.03% level.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fomalont |first=E.B. |date=July 2009 |title=Progress in Measurements of the Gravitational Bending of Radio Waves Using the VLBA |journal=Astrophysical Journal |volume=699 |issue=2 |pages=1395–1402 |bibcode=2009ApJ...699.1395F |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/699/2/1395 |author2=Kopeikin S.M. |author3=Lanyi, G. |author4=Benson, J. |arxiv=0904.3992 |s2cid= 4506243 }}</ref> At this level of precision systematic effects have to be carefully taken into account to determine the precise location of the telescopes on Earth. Some important effects are Earth's [[nutation]], rotation, atmospheric refraction, tectonic displacement and tidal waves. Another important effect is refraction of the radio waves by the [[solar corona]]. Fortunately, this effect has a characteristic [[spectrum]], whereas gravitational distortion is independent of wavelength. Thus, careful analysis, using measurements at several frequencies, can subtract this source of error.

The entire sky is slightly distorted due to the gravitational deflection of light caused by the Sun (the anti-Sun direction excepted). This effect has been observed by the [[European Space Agency]] astrometric satellite [[Hipparcos]]. It measured the positions of about 10<sup>5</sup> stars. During the full mission about {{val|3.5|e=6}} relative positions have been determined, each to an accuracy of typically 3 milliarcseconds (the accuracy for an 8–9 magnitude star). Since the gravitation deflection perpendicular to the Earth–Sun direction is already 4.07 milliarcseconds, corrections are needed for practically all stars. Without systematic effects, the error in an individual observation of 3 milliarcseconds, could be reduced by the square root of the number of positions, leading to a precision of 0.0016 milliarcseconds. Systematic effects, however, limit the accuracy of the determination to 0.3% (Froeschlé, 1997).

Launched in 2013, the [[Gaia (spacecraft)|''Gaia'' spacecraft]] will conduct a census of one billion [[star]]s in the [[Milky Way]] and measure their positions to an accuracy of 24 microarcseconds. Thus it will also provide stringent new tests of gravitational deflection of light caused by the [[Sun]] which was predicted by General relativity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/export/esaSC/120377_index_0_m.html |title=Gaia overview |last=esa }}</ref>

=== Light travel time delay testing ===
{{main|Shapiro time delay}}

[[Irwin I. Shapiro]] proposed another test, beyond the classical tests, which could be performed within the Solar System. It is sometimes called the fourth "classical" test of [[general relativity]]. He predicted a relativistic time delay ([[Shapiro delay]]) in the round-trip travel time for radar signals reflecting off other planets.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Shapiro | first= I. I. | date= December 28, 1964| title=Fourth test of general relativity| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume = 13 | issue = 26 | pages=789–791 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.789 | bibcode=1964PhRvL..13..789S}}</ref> The mere curvature of the path of a [[photon]] passing near the Sun is too small to have an observable delaying effect (when the round-trip time is compared to the time taken if the photon had followed a straight path), but general relativity predicts a time delay that becomes progressively larger when the photon passes nearer to the Sun due to the [[time dilation]] in the [[gravitational potential]] of the Sun. Observing radar reflections from Mercury and Venus just before and after they are eclipsed by the Sun agrees with general relativity theory at the 5% level.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Shapiro | first= I.

More recently, the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini probe]] has undertaken a similar experiment which gave agreement with general relativity at the 0.002% level.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature01997 |title=A test of general relativity using radio links with the Cassini spacecraft |author=Bertotti B. |author2=Iess L. |author3=Tortora P. |journal=Nature |volume=425 |issue=6956 |pages=374–376 |date=2003 |pmid=14508481 |bibcode=2003Natur.425..374B |s2cid=4337125 }}</ref> However, the following detailed studies<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2007.03.036|title=Gravimagnetic effect of the barycentric motion of the Sun and determination of the post-Newtonian parameter γ in the Cassini experiment |author1=Kopeikin S.~M. |author2=Polnarev A.~G. |author3=Schaefer G. |author4= Vlasov I.Yu. |journal=Physics Letters A |volume=367 |issue=4–5 |pages=276–280 |year=2007 |arxiv=gr-qc/0604060 |bibcode=2007PhLA..367..276K |s2cid=18890863 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.15387.x |title=Post-Newtonian limitations on measurement of the PPN parameters caused by motion of gravitating bodies |author1=Kopeikin S.~M. |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=399 |issue=3 |pages=1539–1552 |year=2009 |doi-access=free |arxiv=0809.3433 |bibcode=2009MNRAS.399.1539K |s2cid=10506077 }}</ref> revealed that the measured value of the PPN parameter gamma is affected by a [[gravitoelectromagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] effect caused by the orbital motion of Sun around the [[barycenter]] of the solar system.

Bertotti as having a pure general relativistic origin but its theoretical value has never been tested in the experiment which effectively makes the experimental uncertainty in the measured value of gamma actually larger (by a factor of 10) than 0.002% claimed by B. Bertotti and co-authors in Nature.

=== Equivalence principle ===
{{Main|Equivalence principle}}

The equivalence principle, in its simplest form, asserts that the trajectories of falling bodies in a gravitational field should be independent of their mass and internal structure, provided they are small enough not to disturb the environment or be affected by [[tidal forces]]. This idea has been tested to extremely high precision by [[Eötvös experiment|Eötvös torsion balance experiments]], which look for a differential acceleration between two test masses. Constraints on this, and on the existence of a composition-dependent fifth force or gravitational [[Yukawa interaction]] are very strong, and are discussed under [[fifth force]] and [[weak equivalence principle]].

A version of the equivalence principle, called the [[strong equivalence principle]], asserts that self-gravitation falling bodies, such as stars, planets or black holes (which are all held together by their gravitational attraction) should follow the same trajectories in a gravitational field, provided the same conditions are satisfied. This is called the [[Nordtvedt effect]] and is most precisely tested by the [[Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Nordtvedt | first=K.

Another part of the strong equivalence principle is the requirement that Newton's gravitational constant be constant in time, and have the same value everywhere in the universe. There are many independent observations limiting the possible variation of Newton's [[gravitational constant]],<ref>{{cite journal | last=Uzan | first= J. P. | date= 2003| title=The fundamental constants and their variation: Observational status and theoretical motivations | journal=Reviews of Modern Physics| volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages=403– | arxiv= hep-ph/0205340| doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.75.403 | bibcode=2003RvMP...75..403U| s2cid= 118684485 }}</ref> but one of the best comes from lunar rangefinding which suggests that the gravitational constant does not change by more than one part in 10<sup>11</sup> per year. The constancy of the other constants is discussed in the [[Einstein equivalence principle]] section of the equivalence principle article.

==== Gravitational redshift and time dilation ====
{{main article|Gravitational redshift|Gravitational time dilation}}
{{further|Clock drift#Relativity}}

The first of the classical tests discussed above, the [[gravitational redshift]], is a simple consequence of the [[Einstein equivalence principle]] and was predicted by Einstein in 1907. As such, it is not a test of general relativity in the same way as the post-Newtonian tests, because any theory of gravity obeying the equivalence principle should also incorporate the gravitational redshift. Nonetheless, confirming the existence of the effect was an important substantiation of relativistic gravity, since the absence of gravitational redshift would have strongly contradicted relativity. The first observation of the gravitational redshift was the measurement of the shift in the spectral lines from the [[white dwarf]] star [[Sirius]] B by Adams in 1925, discussed above, and follow-on measurements of other white dwarfs.  Because of the difficulty of the astrophysical measurement, however, experimental verification using a known terrestrial source was preferable.

Experimental verification of gravitational redshift using terrestrial sources took several decades, because it is difficult to find clocks (to measure [[time dilation]]) or sources of electromagnetic radiation (to measure redshift) with a frequency that is known well enough that the effect can be accurately measured. It was confirmed experimentally for the first time in 1959 using measurements of the change in wavelength of gamma-ray photons generated with the [[Mössbauer effect]], which generates radiation with a very narrow line width. The [[Pound–Rebka experiment]] measured the relative redshift of two sources situated at the top and bottom of Harvard University's Jefferson tower.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pound |first=R. V. |date=November 1, 1959 |title=Gravitational Red-Shift in Nuclear Resonance |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=439–441 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.3.439 |author2=Rebka, G. A. Jr. |bibcode=1959PhRvL...3..439P |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Pound |first=R.

Jr. |bibcode=1960PhRvL...4..337P |doi-access=free }}</ref> The result was in excellent agreement with general relativity. This was one of the first precision experiments testing general relativity. The experiment was later improved to better than the 1% level by Pound and Snider.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pound |first=R. V. |author2=Snider J. L. |date=November 2, 1964 |title=Effect of Gravity on Nuclear Resonance |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=13 |issue=18 |pages=539–540 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.539 |bibcode=1964PhRvL..13..539P |doi-access=free }}</ref>

The blueshift of a falling photon can be found by assuming it has an equivalent mass based on its frequency {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''hf ''}} (where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]]) along with {{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}, a result of special relativity. Such simple derivations ignore the fact that in general relativity the experiment compares clock rates, rather than energies. In other words, the "higher energy" of the photon after it falls can be equivalently ascribed to the slower running of clocks deeper in the gravitational potential well. To fully validate general relativity, it is important to also show that the rate of arrival of the photons is greater than the rate at which they are emitted. A very accurate gravitational redshift experiment, which deals with this issue, was performed in 1976,<ref>{{cite journal | display-authors=8 | last=Vessot | first= R. F. C.| date= December 29, 1980| title=Test of Relativistic Gravitation with a Space-Borne Hydrogen Maser | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume = 45 | issue = 26 | pages=2081–2084 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.2081 | author2 = M.

It tested the gravitational redshift to 0.007%.

Although the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is not designed as a test of fundamental physics, it must account for the gravitational redshift in its timing system, and physicists have analyzed timing data from the GPS to confirm other tests. When the first satellite was launched, some engineers resisted the prediction that a noticeable gravitational time dilation would occur, so the first satellite was launched without the clock adjustment that was later built into subsequent satellites. It showed the predicted shift of 38 microseconds per day. This rate of discrepancy is sufficient to substantially impair function of GPS within hours if not accounted for. An excellent account of the role played by general relativity in the design of GPS can be found in Ashby 2003.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Neil |first1=Ashby |date=28 January 2003 |title=Relativity in the Global Positioning System |journal=Living Reviews in Relativity |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=1 |doi=10.12942/lrr-2003-1|doi-access=free |bibcode=2003LRR.....6....1A |pmc=5253894 |pmid=28163638 }}</ref>

This effect should be detectable within the next few years via [[astrometry|astrometric]] monitoring of stars at the center of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Merritt | first1 = D. | last2 = Alexander | first2 = T. | last3 = Mikkola | first3 = S. | last4 = Will | first4 = C. | author-link = David Merritt | title = Testing Properties of the Galactic Center Black Hole Using Stellar Orbits | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | page = 062002 | date = 2010 | bibcode = 2010PhRvD..81f2002M | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.81.062002 |arxiv = 0911.4718 | s2cid = 118646069 }}</ref> By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the [[no-hair theorem]]s of general relativity.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Will | first = C. | author-link = Clifford Will | title = Testing the General Relativistic "No-Hair" Theorems Using the Galactic Center Black Hole Sagittarius A* | journal = Astrophysical Journal Letters | volume = 674 | issue = 1 | pages = L25–L28 | date = 2008 | doi = 10.1086/528847 | bibcode=2008ApJ...674L..25W|arxiv = 0711.1677 | s2cid = 11685632 }}</ref>

The [[Gravity Probe B]] satellite, launched in 2004 and operated until 2005, detected frame-dragging and the [[geodetic effect]]. The experiment used four quartz spheres the size of ping pong balls coated with a superconductor. Data analysis continued through 2011 due to high noise levels and difficulties in modelling the noise accurately so that a useful signal could be found. Principal investigators at [[Stanford University]] reported on May 4, 2011, that they had accurately measured the frame dragging effect relative to the distant star [[IM Pegasi]], and the calculations proved to be in line with the prediction of Einstein's theory. The results, published in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' measured the [[geodetic effect]] with an error of about 0.2 percent. The results reported the frame dragging effect (caused by Earth's rotation) added up to 37 milliarcseconds with an error of about 19 percent.<ref name=Everitt>{{cite journal | author=Everitt | date=2011| title=Gravity Probe B: Final Results of a Space Experiment to Test General Relativity| journal=Physical Review Letters| volume = 106 | issue = 22 | page=221101 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.221101 |arxiv =1105.3456 | bibcode=2011PhRvL.106v1101E | display-authors=1 | last2=Debra | first2=D. | last3=Parkinson | first3=B. | last4=Turneaure | first4=J. | last5=Conklin | first5=J. | last6=Heifetz | first6=M. | last7=Keiser | first7=G. | last8=Silbergleit | first8=A. | last9=Holmes | first9=T. | pmid=21702590| s2cid=11878715}}</ref> Investigator Francis Everitt explained that a milliarcsecond "is the width of a human hair seen at the distance of 10 miles".<ref>{{cite web|author=Ker Than |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/05/110505-einstein-theories-confirmed-gravity-probe-nasa-space-science/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110507220326/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/05/110505-einstein-theories-confirmed-gravity-probe-nasa-space-science/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 7, 2011 |title=Einstein Theories Confirmed by NASA Gravity Probe |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |access-date=2011-05-08|date=2011-05-05 }}</ref>
