**Aphorism:**

For any Extend to be True, All of its Units are Not Unities, and all Oppositions are Not distinct Units.

UNA derives from CS

ONA derives from UNA which derives from CS.

BU derives from ONA which derives from UNA which derives from CS.

So in BU we see Light, the universal balance and recollection of the journey from the Common Source of origination of everything to its observables and observers who define it. Light is the memory of a common source.
