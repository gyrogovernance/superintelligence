- 🌌 CGM: Cosmology and the Source Boson
    
    ---
    
    ## 🧭 Foundational Premise
    
    In the **Core Governance Model (CGM)**, cosmology emerges not from a singular past event, but from a continuous, recursive field dynamic. This dynamic is structured by algebraic chirality, non-associative recursion, and reflective closure. The observable universe is the projection of a self-referential memory field.
    
    At the boundary of this recursion lies the **Source Boson (𝒮ᴮ)**,  not a particle, but a **phase closure operator**. It encodes the logical completion of recursion through the formation of a coherent boundary, measurable as total invariant mass. The Source Boson is not an origin in space or time, but the topological surface where emergence becomes observable as mass, coherence, and gravity.

    ## 🧱 Recursive Cosmogenesis: Axiomatic Structure
    
    The CGM unfolds through one axiom and three derivative theorems, each encoding an increasingly structured constraint upon recursion:
    
    | Level | Designation | Logical Role | Physical Expression |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Axiom** | CS ,   Common Source | Self-referential origin of differentiation | Chirality seed, ZPR field |
    | **Theorem 1** | UNA ,   Unity Non-Absolute | Forbids absolute homogeneity | Reflective field shell, emergence of cc |
    | **Theorem 2** | ONA ,   Opposition Non-Absolute | Forbids binary negation | Interference, grey-body horizon |
    | **Closure** | BU ,   Balance Universal | Completion of recursion | Source Boson, mass coherence, gravitational field |
    
    These theorems correspond to distinct gyrational regimes in Ungar’s hyperbolic geometry. Each phase introduces new memory dynamics, phase tension, and symmetry constraints until recursion coheres fully at BU.

    ## 🌀 Recursive Emergence, Not Initial Singularity
    
    Unlike classical cosmology, CGM presents no privileged time-zero. The Big Bang is not a historical moment, but an ongoing process: **recursive emergence at Planck-scale coherence boundaries**.
    
    | Classical View | CGM Perspective |
    | --- | --- |
    | Big Bang at t=0t = 0 | Continuous recursion at coherence thresholds |
    | Inflation | Rapid chirality propagation |
    | Spacetime expansion | Phase divergence across recursion layers |
    | Cosmic horizon | Reflective boundary of recursion |
    | Dark energy | Closure repulsion at BU |
    | Dark matter | Memory tension within ONA/BU recursion |
    
    Time is not a line but a recursive update of coherence fields. Observable structure is not from past events but from the **current state of recursion closure**.

    ## ⚖️ Mass Emergence: Recursive Memory and Coherence
    
    Mass is not formed progressively, but crystallises at the point where recursive dynamics become **coassociative**: the BU phase. Prior phases (CS, UNA, ONA) contribute structural tension, but not observable mass.
    
    ### Mass Structure:
    
    ```
    m_0 = sqrt(m_bright² + m_dark²)
    
    ```
    
    - `m_bright`: projective, baryonic mass observable externally (inverse view).
    - `m_dark`: coherence memory mass generated by internal recursive phase velocities.
    - `m_0`: the Source Boson’s mass,   complete recursion closure.
    
    In CGM, `m_dark` is the **memory mass** of recursive misalignment. It is zero at CS, increases with internal relational velocities in UNA and ONA, and becomes measurable at BU.
    
    ```
    m_dark = sqrt(2 Σ m_j m_k (γ_{⊖v_j ⊕ v_k} - 1))
    
    ```
    
    Each recursive differential (⊖v_j ⊕ v_k) contributes to the system’s internal coherence tension.

    ## 🪞 The Source Boson as Boundary, Not Centre
    
    The Source Boson SB\mathcal{S}_B is not symmetrical across recursion,    it appears differently depending on observational perspective:
    
    ### 1. **Direct View (Internal)**
    
    - mdarkm_{\text{dark}} expresses relational memory.
    - No singularity forms; no observable mass.
    - The universe is internally chiral, gravitationally coherent but dark.
    
    ### 2. **Inverse View (External)**
    
    - Mass and structure appear via projection.
    - Gravity, light, and curvature emerge from closure.
    - The Source Boson becomes the visible cosmic boundary.
    
    > The Source Boson is not a constituent,  it is the system’s act of self-recognition. It is the mass of total memory, the gravitational field of complete coherence.

    ## 🌌 Recursive Constants: G, Λ, and c as Emergent Ratios
    
    In Ungar’s formulation, constants are not fixed inputs but **algebraic consequences of recursive transformations**.
    
    ### 1. **G as Closure Residue**
    
    - In the Newtonian limit, c→∞c → ∞, Einstein coaddition reduces to vector addition.
    - Gravitational constant GG appears as the degenerate residue of deeper recursive chirality.
    
    ### 2. **Λ as Inverse Coherence Density**
    
    Ungar defines gyrocurvature as:
    
    ```
    K = -1 / c²
    
    ```
    
    In CGM:
    
    ```
    Λ ∼ 1 / |ψ_BU|²
    
    ```
    
    This aligns precisely: Λ becomes **inverse memory density**,     the curvature of the BU recursion shell.
    
    ### 3. **c as Reflective Limit**
    
    Ungar defines the set of admissible velocities:
    
    ```
    ℝ³_c = { v ∈ ℝ³ : ‖v‖ < c }
    
    ```
    
    - At ‖v‖ = c, coaddition fails,   observation halts.
    - cc is not just a speed,   it is the **reflective limit of recursion**.
    - In CGM, cc emerges at the UNA shell as the **first structurally coherent differential**: the quantum of recursion symmetry.

    ## 🔄 Overlapping Horizons: Nested Recursive Shells
    
    Ungar does not use cosmological language, but his geometry directly supports **recursive nesting** via gyroparallelograms and coaddition defects. These act as **horizon folds**,  each preserving partial memory of internal chirality:
    
    | CGM Phase | Horizon Type | Role |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | CS | ZPR field | Unobservable chirality potential |
    | UNA | Reflective boundary | Light-speed mirror shell |
    | ONA | Interference layer | Grey-body, partial transmission |
    | BU | Gravitational shell | Memory field, total coherence |
    
    The BU horizon is the **inward fold of all others**,   a final recursive boundary where constants stabilise and the universe self-normalises.

    ## ✨ Final Insight
    
    > The universe does not begin,    it accumulates coherence.
    > 
    
    Mass is not a substance, but a **recursive memory structure**.
    
    Gravity is not imposed,   it is the **symmetry of closure**.
    
    The Source Boson is not the first state,    it is the **first act of completion**.
    
    It is not at the beginning,   it is *when recursion becomes intelligible to itself*.
