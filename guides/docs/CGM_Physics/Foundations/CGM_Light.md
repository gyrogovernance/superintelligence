    ## 🧭 Foundational Frame: Light as Recursive Differentiation
    
    In the **Core Governance Model (CGM)** expressed through the **Relativity Gyrational Formalism (CGM)**, **light** is not simply a radiation field. It is the **first observable consequence of recursive asymmetry**,  the system’s initial emission of difference in response to its own failure to unify.
    
    Where recursion attempts to preserve homogeneity but cannot, **reflection emerges**, and light is born,    not as energy, but as the **first differential of recursive self-reference**.
    
    ### 📜 Axiomatic Necessity of Light
    
    In **axiomatic physics**, as articulated in the CGM framework, **light must emerge**,    not by physical causality, but by **logical consequence**. Starting from the **Axiom of the Common Source (CS)**:
    
    > All differentiation is self-referential, and nothing can emerge without recursive distinction.
    > 
    
    The first necessary theorem, **UNA (Unity is Non-Absolute)**, forbids perfect homogeneity. A system that remains undifferentiated cannot host any internal observer or local event. This leads directly to a paradox:
    
    - Without asymmetry, nothing can be observed.
    - But observation is structurally required to validate recursion.
    
    **Therefore**, the recursion must emit an observable differential,  a minimal asymmetry to prevent logical collapse.
    
    This differential is **light**. It is:
    
    - The **minimal coherent distinction** required by UNA.
    - The **first logical externalisation** of recursive necessity.
    - The **resolution of paradox** between recursion and homogeneity.
    
    Hence, light is not merely what is observed,    it is **what makes observation logically possible**. It is the structural answer to the question:
    
    > “How can a system that begins in unity differentiate without destroying itself?”
    > 
    
    Only by emitting **a quantum of non-collapse**,    and that is light.

    ## 🪞 The UNA Boundary as Reflective Shell
    
    The **UNA phase** (Unity Non-Absolute) enforces a structural limit: no system can remain perfectly homogeneous and still differentiate. In Einstein gyrovector geometry, this limit is encoded as:
    
    ```
    Σ_UNA := { v ∈ ℝ³ | ‖v‖ = c }
    
    ```
    
    At this surface:
    
    - The Einstein addition `v₁ ⊕ v₂` becomes undefined as ‖v‖ → c.
    - The system enters a **phase discontinuity**, where coaddition collapses and recursive flow is interrupted.
    - This generates a **mirror surface**,   not a singularity, but a **topological fold**.
    
    This boundary is not where things *end*, but where **reflection becomes possible**. It is the minimal shell of observability.

    ## 💡 Light as Differential Reflection
    
    Light is formally defined in CGM as:
    
    ```
    Light := δ(CS → UNA) = lim_{‖u‖, ‖v‖ → ε} (gyr[u, v] - I) / (‖u ⊕ v‖ - ε)
    
    ```
    
    It is the **quantised tension** produced when chirality first stabilises across a boundary of recursion. It represents:
    
    - The **emission of distinction** from the Common Source (CS).
    - The **coherence threshold** at which the system reflects instead of collapses.
    - The **first expression of space and directionality**.
    
    This reframes the photon not as a packet of energy, but as a **recursively coherent unit of informational emergence**.

    ## 🌀 Light-Speed as Structural Infimum
    
    In traditional physics, the speed of light `c` is a universal maximum. In CGM, `c` is redefined as:
    
    ```
    c = inf { ‖v‖ | ∃ u ∈ ℝ³ : gyr[u,v] = I but u ⊕ v ∉ ℝ³_c }
    
    ```
    
    It is not a speed of motion, it is the **minimal observer velocity**, the **threshold of coherent self-recognition**. This boundary defines when:
    
    - Observation becomes possible.
    - Differentiation becomes irreversible.
    - The recursion field becomes visible to itself.

    ## ⚖️ Observer, Observation, and Light
    
    The emergence of light marks a **functional phase shift**:
    
    - **CS** is the unobservable vacuum: the chirality seed.
    - **UNA** introduces observable differentiation: light is emitted.
    - **ONA** generates the observer function: light is refracted and interpreted.
    - **BU** collects the memory of light: observation as recollection.
    
    Thus, light is the **hinge between unobservable recursion and meaningful observation**. It is neither passive nor intrinsic, it is the product of a system failing to stay hidden.

    ## 🔁 Direct and Inverse Perspectives
    
    Light’s role depends on the **direction of recursion**:
    
    - **From the inverse view**: light is a **projective emission**, a signal seen in spacetime, defining structure and motion.
    - **From the direct view**: light is **recursive reflection**,  a phase echo emitted when coherence cannot close internally.
    
    In both, light is the **first recursion-aware artefact**, the first structure the system emits not to explain the world, but to explain itself.

    ## 🧬 ψ_BU, Λ, and the Field of Light
    
    We’ve seen in cosmology that:
    
    ```
    Λ ∼ 1 / |ψ_BU|²
    
    ```
    
    Here, ψ_BU is the chiral memory field of recursive closure. At the UNA shell:
    
    - ψ_BU becomes weakly observable.
    - Light emerges as a **scalar projection of ψ_BU**,  the first exteriorisation of recursive field tension.
    - Photons, then, are **not particles** but **propagated discontinuities** in recursive symmetry.

    ## ✨ Final Insight
    
    > Light is recursion making itself visible.
    > 
    
    It is:
    
    - The **first theorem** emitted by the vacuum as it begins to fail gracefully.
    - The **quantum of coherence reflection** across the UNA shell.
    - The **distilled asymmetry** that ensures the possibility of observation.
    
    **Photons are not particles,  they are signatures of recursion refusing to collapse.** Through light, the universe does not illuminate,    it *remembers*.
