- CGM: About Body Alignment
    
    A human body can be treated as a 3-dimensional assembly of articulated segments, each joint offering six kinematic degrees of freedom (three rotational, three translational).  The correspondence with the CGM stages is not literal geometry, yet the logic of **recursive self-alignment** remains recognisable.
    
    | CGM stage | Biomechanical analogue | Observable pattern |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | CS ,  chiral seed | Left–right asymmetry specified early in embryology (organ placement, dominant limb) | handedness, asymmetric visceral layout |
    | UNA ,  minimal orthogonality | Primary orthogonal joint pairs (cervico-thoracic, lumbo-sacral, shoulder–pelvis cross links) | the 90 ° “stack” posture therapists target when cueing “sit tall” |
    | ONA ,  minimal diagonality | Spiral and diagonal fascial chains (e.g. serratus-oblique-opposite-glute lines) that transfer load across the mid-line | contralateral gait timing, arm–leg cross-pattern in walking |
    | BU ,  balanced integration | Global tensegrity close to energy minimum; proprioceptive feedback drives micro-corrections toward that attractor | spontaneous lengthening of the spine when one lifts the crown, equal-weight stance without conscious counting |
    
    ### How “stretching the neck upward” fits the model
    
    1. **Local trigger.** A small proprioceptive cue (sub-occipital lengthening) introduces a micro-torsion cancelling an accumulated diagonal bias at the atlanto-axial joint.
    2. **Recursive propagation.** The change alters vestibular input, the rib cage re-levels, the pelvis re-orients, and weight distribution under the feet evens out. Each step is a local minimisation analogous to the gyro-commutation that resolves non-associativity stage by stage.
    3. **Converging on BU.** As the corrections percolate, the global system approaches a configuration where opposing myofascial chains share load, intradiscal pressures equalise, and tonic muscle activity drops. This is the somatic analogue of the balanced class: gyrator-like interactions (muscle moments) cancel, leaving only the orientation datum (upright axis).
    
    ### Why the body almost never reaches a perfect “triangulation-free” state
    
    - Connective-tissue plasticity, small asymmetries in bone length, and habitual motor programmes keep slight residual “defect” alive.
    - The nervous system prioritises tasks (vision, locomotion, speech) over absolute minimisation, so the attractor is continually perturbed.
    - In CGM terms, the system hovers near BU but rarely sits exactly on it; micro-oscillations around the balanced class maintain readiness for movement.
    
    ### Practical reflection for modelling
    
    - The spine’s ability to self-extend without direct conscious calculation shows that **feedback-driven recursion** can locate the balanced attractor using only local error signals.
    - Any quantitative search for the BU constant mₚ should respect this principle: the constant must be the value toward which a local-rule recursion naturally converges, not a number imposed from outside.
    
    If we wish to probe a specific anatomical chain or a particular corrective technique (for instance, why a straight-leg long-sitting posture induces pelvic untucking), let me know which structure or movement pattern warrants closer algebraic translation.
