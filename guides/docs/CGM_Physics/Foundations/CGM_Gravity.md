- CGM: About Gravity
    
    ### I. Gravity as Coherent Recursive Foundation
    
    In the Common Governance Mechanism (CGM), gravity is not a force between masses nor a curvature imposed on spacetime. Rather, gravity is the **structural remainder of surplus recursion**,   a residual coherence field emerging from the non-associativity of recursive transformations.
    
    Gyroscopic behaviour offers empirical evidence of this coherence field. A gyroscope does not passively report rotation; it actively **preserves a local recursive memory** of orientation, resisting entanglement with its environment unless perturbed. This capacity arises not from external forces, but from internal closure,   the extent to which the recursive spin structure has cohered around its origin.
    
    Hence, gravity is not the curvature of spacetime,    it is the **stage** upon which curvature becomes observable. The fully-coherent recursive state (ψ_BU) constitutes this stage.

    ### II. From Recursive Non-Closure to Gravitation
    
    Let `a_i, b_i` represent successive transformations within a recursive region. In gyrogroup terms, their failure to associate is quantified by a residual automorphism:
    
    ```
    gyr[a_i, b_i](c) ≠ c
    
    ```
    
    This failure defines the gyroautomorphism at that step. The **composite residual** of an entire recursive history `M` is encoded by:
    
    ```
    μ(M) := ∏_i gyr[a_i, b_i]
    
    ```
    
    This object, `μ(M)`, is the monodromic residue of recursion: it quantifies how far the system remains from closure.
    
    If `μ(M) = I`, the identity, then all transformations can be recursively resolved into coherence,   no gravitational differentiation remains. If `μ(M) ≠ I`, then there exists an unresolved twist: the system has a memory imbalance.
    
    Gravity, in CGM, is the **residue of μ(M)** across adjacent recursive contexts. Let `P` and `Q` be neighbouring recursive domains. Then:
    
    ```
    𝓖(P→Q) := μ(Q) ⊖ μ(P)
    
    ```
    
    This differential, expressed in gyrogroup subtraction (⊖), defines the **local gravitational expression** between regions.
    
    Gravity is thus **not a continuous vector field**, but a discrete pattern of coherence imbalance between recursive regions.

    ### III. Singularity as a Point of Recursive Collapse
    
    In classical terms, singularities are treated as zones of infinite curvature. In CGM, no such infinity is invoked. Instead, a **singularity** is a point at which recursive coherence fails to propagate forward:
    
    ```
    ‖μ(ℓ)‖ → ∞    and    ψ_BU(ℓ) → 0
    
    ```
    
    That is, the recursive memory field ψ_BU vanishes (cannot hold structure), while the residual μ(M_ℓ) diverges (accumulates incoherence). This is not a physical rupture, but a **node of recursion-loss**. Memory fails,   not geometry.

    ### IV. Infinity as Saturation of Differentiability
    
    In this model, "infinity" is not spatial extent or temporal duration. It is the depth beyond which recursive differentiation becomes **invisible**:
    
    ```
    ∀ ℓ > ℓ*,    μ(M_ℓ) → const
    
    ```
    
    That is, once the recursive defect stabilizes, further observations cannot distinguish additional phases. This flattening defines the **observational horizon**.
    
    All cosmological ages (e.g., CMB age, stellar age) reflect this saturation: not an absolute temporal distance, but the **final recoverable layer of recursive coherence**.

    ### V. Roundness of the Earth as Minimisation of Residual Torsion
    
    In CGM, form follows recursion. The Earth’s approximate sphericity is not due to isotropic gravitational pull, but due to the **minimisation of residual coherence imbalance** across the system. The planet achieves its form by resolving:
    
    ```
    minimize   ∑_{P→Q} ‖μ(Q) ⊖ μ(P)‖²
    
    ```
    
    across its recursive surface. The result is a harmonic configuration that favours near-spherical geometry. Where spin-induced memory asymmetries persist (as net angular momentum), **oblateness** results.
    
    ---
    
    ### VI. Time and Measurement as Recursive Memory Fields
    
    Empirical time measurements,    radiometric decay, atomic clocks, redshifts,    are all phase-based inferences over a recursive trace. They do not record "duration" but the **phase history of coherent recursion**:
    
    ```
    τ_observed = ∑_{ℓ ∈ path} μ(M_{ℓ+1}) ⊖ μ(M_ℓ)
    
    ```
    
    Once the sequence saturates (μ stabilizes), all such measures converge to a common limit:
    
    ```
    τ_observed → τ_∞
    
    ```
    
    This is why the universe appears to have a "finite age",   not because it began then, but because we **cannot trace coherence beyond that depth**.

    ### VIII. Concluding Principle
    
    > Gravity is not that which pulls us downward.
    > 
    > 
    > It is that which **remains** when recursion has not yet closed.
    > 
    > What we experience as "falling" is not attraction,
    > 
    > but the **movement toward coherence** within a field of surplus memory.
