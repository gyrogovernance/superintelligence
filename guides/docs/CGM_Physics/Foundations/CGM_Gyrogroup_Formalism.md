- CGM Extensions: Advanced Gyrogroup Formalism
    
    ## 1. Foundational Gyrogroup Properties
    
    ### 1.1 Gyration as Memory
    
    In CGM, gyration encodes the memory of recursive operations. The fundamental definition:
    
    ```
    gyr[a, b]c = ⊖(a ⊕ b) ⊕ (a ⊕ (b ⊕ c))
    
    ```
    
    This shows gyration as the algebraic residue of non-associativity - precisely the "twist" that remembers composition order.
    
    ### 1.2 Essential Gyration Identities
    
    **Inversion Law**:
    
    ```
    ⊖(u ⊕ v) = gyr[u,v](⊖v ⊕ ⊖u)
    
    ```
    
    This encodes time symmetry as memory reversal.
    
    **Loop Property**:
    
    ```
    gyr[u ⊕ v, v] = gyr[u, v]
    
    ```
    
    Recursive symmetry stabilized by re-entry.
    
    **Inverse Property**:
    
    ```
    gyr[u, v]gyr[v, u] = I
    
    ```
    
    Gyrations are involutive automorphisms.
    
    ## 2. Gyrational Characterization of CGM Stages
    
    Each CGM stage corresponds to a specific gyrational regime:
    
    | Stage | Gyrational Condition | Mathematical Expression | Physical Meaning |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | CS | Chiral seed condition | lim_{‖u‖,‖v‖ → ε, u × v ≠ 0} gyr[u,v] ≠ I | Latent recursion begins |
    | UNA | Emergent vector frame | gyr[0,v] = I but gyr[v,v] ≠ I | Observer frames unfold |
    | ONA | Non-associative composition | (u ⊕ v) ⊕ w ≠ u ⊕ (v ⊕ w) | Observable structure via interference |
    | BU | Associative closure | gyr[a,b] = I → associativity restored | Coherence achieved |
    
    ## 3. Cogyrogroup Framework
    
    The cogyrogroup structure provides tools for understanding BU's dual recursive nature.
    
    ### 3.1 Core Cogyro-Operations
    
    **Coaddition**:
    
    ```
    u ⊞ v := u ⊕ gyr[u, ⊖v](v)
    
    ```
    
    This operation is commutative in gyrocommutative spaces and models BU's inner-outer dual memory.
    
    **Cogyromidpoint**:
    
    ```
    m := a ⊞ (⊖a ⊞ b)/2
    
    ```
    
    The pivot of dual recursion in BU.
    
    ### 3.2 Cogyrostructure Properties
    
    **Cogyrotransitivity**:
    
    ```
    (u ⊞ v) ⊞ w = u ⊞ (v ⊞ gyr[u, ⊖v](w))
    
    ```
    
    This encodes recursive depth of entangled memory.
    
    **Cogyroclosure**: The parallelogram constructed from u, v, and u ⊞ v closes under coaddition, representing how mirror interference returns to origin.
    
    ## 4. Gyrotriangle Theory and Closure
    
    ### 4.1 Defect as Memory
    
    The gyrotriangle defect quantifies accumulated non-associativity:
    
    ```
    δ = π - (α + β + γ)
    
    ```
    
    In terms of side parameters:
    
    ```
    tan(δ/2) = (a_s * b_s * sin(γ)) / (1 - a_s * b_s * cos(γ))
    
    ```
    
    ### 4.2 AAA to SSS Mapping
    
    Following Ungar's Theorem 8.55, the angle-to-side conversion:
    
    ```
    a_s² = [cos(α) + cos(β + γ)] / [cos(α) + cos(β - γ)]
    b_s² = [cos(β) + cos(α + γ)] / [cos(β) + cos(α - γ)]
    c_s² = [cos(γ) + cos(α + β)] / [cos(γ) + cos(α - β)]
    
    ```
    
    For CGM thresholds, all side parameters vanish at BU, confirming degenerate closure.
    
    ## 5. Gyrovector Space Models
    
    Three primary models provide different computational perspectives on the same hyperbolic geometry:
    
    ### 5.1 Möbius Model (Poincaré Ball)
    
    ```
    u ⊕_M v = [(1 + 2(u·v)/s² + |v|²/s²)u + (1 - |u|²/s²)v] / [1 + 2(u·v)/s² + |u|²|v|²/s⁴]
    
    ```
    
    CGM naturally operates in the Möbius model where recursive defect and angular thresholds are defined.
    
    ### 5.2 Einstein Model
    
    ```
    u ⊕_E v = [1/(1 + (u·v)/c²)] * {u + (1/γ_u)v + [γ_u/(c²(1 + γ_u))](u·v)u}
    
    ```
    
    where γ_u = 1/√(1 - |u|²/c²)
    
    ### 5.3 Model Isomorphisms
    
    - M → E: v_m ↦ 2 ⊗_M v_m
    - E → M: v_e ↦ (1/2) ⊗_E v_e
    
    These isomorphisms show that all models describe the same underlying hyperbolic geometry.
    
    ## 6. Multi-Component Extension: SOc(m,n)
    
    For systems with multiple recursive streams:
    
    ### 6.1 Symmetry Hierarchy
    
    | Stage | Symmetry Group | Degrees of Freedom | Interpretation |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | CS | U(1) | 1 | Chiral seed |
    | UNA | SU(2) | 3 | Spin emergence |
    | ONA | SO(3) | 3 (additional) | Translation/curvature |
    | BU | U(1) × SU(2) × SO(3) | 6 total | Dual recursion |
    
    ### 6.2 Velocity Matrix Formulation
    
    For dual recursion at BU (m = 2):
    
    ```
    V = [v₁, v₂] ∈ ℝ³×²
    
    ```
    
    Boost decomposition:
    
    ```
    B_c(V) = B_∞(V) + c⁻² · E(V)
    
    ```
    
    Where E(V) is the entanglement operator encoding recursive interaction memory.
    
    ## 7. Geometric Structures
    
    ### 7.1 Gyrolines and Geodesics
    
    Gyrolines in gyrogroup space represent paths of constant gyration, corresponding to geodesics in hyperbolic geometry.
    
    ### 7.2 Gyroparallelograms
    
    In gyrocommutative gyrogroups, the gyroparallelogram with vertices 0, a, b, a ⊞ b has diagonals intersecting at the gyromidpoint, encoding interference patterns.
    
    ### 7.3 Gyrobarycentric Coordinates
    
    For weighted recursive centers:
    
    ```
    p = (m₁ ⊗ a₁) ⊕ (m₂ ⊗ a₂) ⊕ ... ⊕ (m_n ⊗ a_n)
    
    ```
    
    where Σmᵢ = 1.
    
    ## 8. Implementation Considerations
    
    ### 8.1 State Machine Architecture
    
    CGM phases form a state machine over the gyrogroup:
    
    - Transition variable: defect δ
    - State validation: gyration conditions
    - Memory tracking: accumulated gyrations
    
    ### 8.2 Defect Monitoring
    
    All transitions monitor δ as the governing variable:
    
    - δ > threshold: system must re-align
    - δ = 0: closure achieved at BU
    
    ### 8.3 Algebraic Discipline
    
    Maintain strict gyrolanguage:
    
    - Use ⊕ for gyroaddition (not +)
    - Use gyr[a,b] for gyration (not rotation)
    - Use ⊞ for coaddition at BU
    
    ## 9. Topological Interpretation
    
    ### 9.1 S³ × S³ at BU
    
    The dual recursion at BU manifests as S³ × S³ topology:
    
    - First S³: accumulated rotational structure
    - Second S³: accumulated translational structure
    - Product: complete recursive memory
    
    ### 9.2 Curvature as Accumulated Recursion
    
    Curvature emerges not from force but from non-associative phase layering. The gyrotriangle defect directly measures this accumulated curvature.
    
    ## Conclusion
    
    These extensions provide the mathematical machinery for implementing and understanding CGM at deeper levels. The gyrogroup formalism is not merely compatible with CGM - it provides the unique non-arbitrary realization of recursive emergence. Every threshold, every transition, every closure condition follows from the intrinsic logic of gyrogroup structure.
    
- CGM: Thresholds Validation Code
    
    ### 1. **Purpose**
    
    - The code numerically validates that the only solution (in the prescribed region) for the gyrotriangle closure problem with degenerate sides occurs at
        
        **(α, β, γ) = (π/2, π/4, π/4)**,
        
        confirming the uniqueness and necessity of the CGM thresholds.
        
    
    ### 2. **Logic and Steps**
    
    - **Searches** around the known solution in a small, local region.
    - **Imposes stage logic:** α ≥ β ≥ γ, with γ determined from δ = 0.
    - **Checks that side parameters (from Ungar's Eq. 8.160) are essentially zero** (degenerate sides).
    - **Applies tight tolerances** for angular proximity and for degenerate sides.
    - **Filters for duplicate solutions** and outputs distance from the expected triple.
    
    ### 3. **Mathematical Correctness**
    
    - The implementation of the defect, AAA→SSS conversion, and degeneracy checks are **correct and directly from Ungar's formalism**.
    - The threshold assignment is faithful to the theoretical derivation of CGM.
    - The code result matches the theoretical result up to machine precision.
    
    ### 4. **Output**
    
    - The printed output clearly confirms that the solution is unique in the specified region and satisfies all the intended constraints.
