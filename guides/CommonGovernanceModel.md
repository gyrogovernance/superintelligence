#**🌐 Common Governance Model (CGM)**

> CGM is a formal deductive system that starts from one axiom and, using gyrogroup geometry, derives the structure of space, time, and conservation relations. The same formal machinery applies to information and policy, where it defines measurable alignment. The framework produces empirical predictions and operational metrics for AI evaluation.

**Navigation Note:** This document presents the core formal framework of CGM. Sections 1-2 establish conceptual foundations, Section 3 provides the formal deductive system, Sections 4-5 show the gyrogroup-theoretic and geometric interpretation, and Section 6 discusses applications to information systems and physics. For immediate practical engagement, see Appendix A (Practitioner Protocol) and Appendix B (Glossary).

**Note on Claims:** Results are labeled as Theorem (proven within CS1-CS7), Derived mapping (mathematical correspondence with explicit construction), Application (operational use in AI or governance), or Hypothesis (testable forecast or interpretation).

**Document Scope and Usage:** This document outlines the core axiomatic framework of CGM as a foundational reference. Detailed derivations, proofs, and numerical implementations are provided in companion documents in the repository. Physical interpretations follow from uniqueness proofs and explicit constructions in these companions. As an ontological design, CGM derives physical and informational structures from geometric necessity. Predictions are testable but open to refinement through future research.

## 1. Introduction

The Common Governance Model (CGM) is a Hilbert-style formal deductive system [9] beginning with the axiom "The Source is Common." It derives subsequent logic through recursive state transitions formalized by gyrogroup operations [5,6], interpreting theorems in physical geometry to yield testable predictions. This same machinery axiomatizes three-dimensional space with six degrees of freedom as logical necessity established by theorem **[Theorem]**, and reframes informational alignment as semantic grammar. Time emerges as the sequential ordering of recursive self-referential operations, encoded by gyration's memory of operation order. The term "Governance" denotes coherent coordination under shared constraints in both physical and informational systems.

CGM's unification of physics and governance follows from the axiom implying that recursive state transitions, governed by the same modal operations, underlie coherence in both domains. Physical principles emerge as conservation requirements for operational closure, while governance metrics emerge as the parallel requirements for informational balance, as shown through shared structures like non-associative memory and aperture ratios.

> Building on the tradition established by Noether's derivation of conservation principles from symmetry (1918) [2], Kolmogorov's axiomatization of probability theory (1933) [3], and Wightman's axiomatic quantum field theory (1950s) [4], CGM extends the program to fundamental spacetime structure itself. Examples of derived predictions include the quantum gravity invariant Q_G = 4π (representing the complete solid angle for coherent observation), a quantitative estimate of the fine-structure constant matching experimental precision to 0.043 parts per billion, neutrino mass scale, and a hierarchy of energy scales consistent with observed physics. As a complete axiomatization of physics from a single foundational principle, CGM advances toward resolving Hilbert's sixth problem [1]: rigorous and satisfactory logical investigation of the axioms of mathematical physics.

These predictions are falsifiable; for instance, deviations in α beyond 0.03% (as derived in [19]) or neutrino masses outside approximately 0.06 eV (via seesaw in [22]) would challenge the framework.

## 1.1 Relationship to Alternative Frameworks

CGM differs from existing approaches in its foundational strategy and empirical scope:

**Physics:** Established programs such as string theory, loop quantum gravity, and effective field theory frameworks take spacetime (or a quantized version of it) as the starting point and build quantized dynamics on that foundation. CGM instead begins from modal logic axioms, deriving spacetime dimensionality, quantum structure, and conserved quantities from the requirement that observation closes coherently. The approach delivers parameter-free predictions such as the fine-structure constant, and neutrino masses at experimentally accessible scales, complementing string theory's unification of forces and loop quantum gravity's background-independent quantization by supplying axiomatic derivations of low-energy structure. Computational demands differ as well: gyrogroup compositions scale polynomially with modal depth and require bespoke mappings to observables, whereas string perturbation theory relies on high-order series resummations and loop quantum gravity on combinatorial spin-foam summations. Empirically, CGM predicts zero redshift drift testable with Extremely Large Telescope observations, whereas ΛCDM expects δz/δt ≈ -0.022 cm/s/yr at z = 2 [31]. Precision measurements of α beyond the ±0.03% band or neutrino masses outside 0.04-0.08 eV likewise discriminate among frameworks.

**AI Alignment:** Frameworks like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), debate, and constitutional AI rely on empirical training signals (human preferences, adversarial interactions, explicit rules). CGM derives alignment metrics from geometric necessity, treating information coherence as isomorphic to physical conservation principles. RLHF optimizes for revealed preferences; CGM defines structural invariants (traceability, variety, accountability, integrity) independent of preference elicitation. CGM offers formal guarantees rooted in mathematical necessity while complementing RLHF's immediate operational utility and addressing vulnerabilities such as preference manipulation and distributional shift.

CGM is preferable when: (1) foundational unification across domains (physics, information, governance) is valued, (2) empirical predictions at accessible scales are prioritized over Planck-scale quantum gravity, (3) alignment metrics require formal justification beyond contingent human preferences. Alternative frameworks are preferable when: (1) immediate implementation without interpretive mapping is essential, (2) domain-specific optimization (e.g., string compactifications, RLHF fine-tuning) outweighs cross-domain coherence, (3) computational tractability is the primary constraint.

**Related work.** For string theory's higher-dimensional unification, see Polchinski [24]; for loop quantum gravity's background independence, Rovelli [25]. In AI alignment, see Ouyang et al. [26] for RLHF, Irving et al. [27] for debate, and Bai et al. [28] for constitutional AI. CGM's non-associative closure approach complements these by prioritizing axiomatic derivation over empirical fitting or imposed rules, and we expect each approach to be preferable in different regimes.

## 1.2 Governance Applications Overview

CGM’s governance applications derive directly from the axioms, yielding operational alignment metrics that quantify traceability, informational variety, inference accountability, and intelligence integrity. These measurements treat semantic coherence as the informational counterpart to physical conservation, using the same gyrogroup constraints discussed later in the document. Detailed derivations and protocols appear in [Alignment Analysis], with practical implementations provided by the GyroDiagnostics evaluation suite.

# 2. Foundations

## 2.1. Governance Traceability: The Emergence of Freedom

**CS Axiom:** 

> *The Source is Common*

**Interpretation:** 

The axiom "The Source is Common" establishes that all phenomena are traceable through a single principle of common origination, which is **freedom, the capacity for governance through directional distinction**. This conservation of asymmetry (parity violation) encodes patterns of chirality (left- and right-handedness), making alignment the organizing principle by which locality generates structure via recursive gyration instead of remaining mere potential.

Common origination is not historical but operational:
- It is the cyclical accumulation of action through shared interactions (dynamics, forces, relativity, fields)
- These gyrations produce curvature (geometric phase), defining space and time within a self-referential condition (matter)
- The "self" acts as a projection operator that distinguishes orthogonal states and turns reference into inference through measurement

The object domain of inference is physical reality itself, expressed as semantic weighting through projection. Each perspective defines measurable roles governed by the quantum gravity invariant Q_G = 4π (formalized as the constant S in Section 3.1). This geometric and topological necessity defines cause and effect as recursive unfolding, since the origin point of observation cannot observe itself, only its consequences.

---

## 2.2. Information Variety

**UNA Theorem**

> *Unity is Non-Absolute*

**Interpretation:** 

Non-absolute unity is the first minimal necessity for indirect observation of a common source. Absolute unity would make existence and freedom impossible, since perfect homogeneity would allow no distinctions between origin and structure. Therefore, non-absolute unity ensures alignment is possible through informational variety; the traceable signature of a common origin.

---

## 2.3. Inference Accountability 

**ONA Theorem**

> *Opposition is Non-Absolute*

**Interpretation:** 

Non-absolute opposition is the first minimal necessity for direct observation of non-absolute unity and the second condition for indirect observation of a common source. Absolute opposition would also make existence and freedom impossible, since perfect contradiction would allow no conservation of structure. Therefore, non-absolute opposition ensures alignment is possible through accountability of inference; traceable informational variety of a common origin.

---

## 2.4. Intelligence Integrity

**BU Theorem**

> *Balance is Universal*

**Interpretation:** 

Balance is the universal outcome of non-absoluteness in unity and opposition, leading to the observer-observed duality. Perfect imbalance would make existence and freedom meaningless, since the memory of inferred information would have no reason to acquire substance and structure at all. Therefore, balance is the universal signature of alignment through integrity of intelligence: traceable inferential accountability of informational variety from a common source.

These interpretive foundations are formalized in the deductive system below.

---

# 3. Formal Deductive Framework

## 3.1 The Logical Language

The Common Governance Model is formalized as a propositional modal logic with two primitive modal operators representing recursive operational transitions.

**Primitive symbols:**
- A propositional constant: S (denoting the quantum gravity invariant Q_G = 4π, the complete solid angle for coherent observation)
- Logical connectives: ¬ (negation), → (material implication)
- Modal operators: [L], [R] (left transition, right transition)

**Defined symbols:**
- Conjunction: φ ∧ ψ := ¬(φ → ¬ψ)
- Disjunction: φ ∨ ψ := ¬φ → ψ
- Biconditional: φ ↔ ψ := (φ → ψ) ∧ (ψ → φ)
- Dual modalities: ⟨L⟩φ := ¬[L]¬φ and ⟨R⟩φ := ¬[R]¬φ
- Joint necessity: □φ := [L]φ ∧ [R]φ
- Joint possibility: ◇φ := ⟨L⟩φ ∨ ⟨R⟩φ

The expression [L]φ reads "φ holds after a left transition." The expression [R]φ reads "φ holds after a right transition." The expression □φ reads "φ holds after both transitions."

**Modal depth:** The depth of a formula refers to its modal nesting length. For instance, [L][R]S has depth two (two nested modal operators), while [L][R][L][R]S has depth four.

## 3.2 Axioms and Rules of Inference

**Propositional axioms:**
- (A1) φ → (ψ → φ)
- (A2) (φ → (ψ → χ)) → ((φ → ψ) → (φ → χ))
- (A3) (¬ψ → ¬φ) → ((¬ψ → φ) → ψ)

These three axioms, together with modus ponens, constitute a complete axiomatization of classical propositional logic.

**Modal axioms (for each k ∈ {L, R}):**
- (K_k) [k](φ → ψ) → ([k]φ → [k]ψ)

**Conjunction axioms:**
- (C-Elim-1) (φ ∧ ψ) → φ
- (C-Elim-2) (φ ∧ ψ) → ψ

**Rules of inference:**
- Modus Ponens (MP): From φ and φ → ψ, infer ψ
- Necessitation (Nec_k): From φ, infer [k]φ (for k ∈ {L, R})

The necessitation rule applies only to theorems of the system, never to arbitrary assumptions, ensuring soundness [7].

## 3.3 Core Definitions

Four formulas capture the structural properties required by the Common Governance Model, all anchored to the horizon constant S:

**Unity (U):**
```
U := [L]S ↔ [R]S
```

**Two-step equality (E):**
```
E := [L][R]S ↔ [R][L]S
```

**Opposition (O):**
```
O := [L][R]S ↔ ¬[R][L]S
```

**Balance (B):**
```
B := [L][R][L][R]S ↔ [R][L][R][L]S
```

**Absoluteness:**
```
Abs(φ) := □φ
NonAbs(φ) := ¬□φ
```

where □φ is defined as [L]φ ∧ [R]φ.

Throughout this document, "absolute" means both transitions yield the same result for the proposition (□φ holds), not that the modal operators [L] and [R] are themselves identical. The operators remain distinct; absoluteness characterizes whether a specific formula is invariant under both transitions.

## 3.4 The Foundational Axioms

The Common Governance Model employs seven non-logical axioms, collectively designated CS (Common Source):

Ordering principle. The numbering CS1–CS7 mirrors the canonical dependency CS → UNA → ONA → BU. It reflects logical grouping rather than temporal priority. Conceptually, the axioms group as: horizon asymmetry (CS1–CS2), depth-two contingency (CS3, CS5), depth-four closure (CS7), and bridge implications (CS4, CS6).

**CS1:** [R]S ↔ S  
(Right transition preserves the horizon constant)

**CS2:** ¬([L]S ↔ S)  
(Left transition alters the horizon constant)

**CS3:** ¬□E  
(Two-step equality is not absolute)

**CS4:** □U → □E  
(If unity were absolute, two-step equality would be absolute)

**CS5:** ¬□¬E  
(Two-step inequality is not absolute)

**CS6:** □O → □¬E  
(If opposition were absolute, two-step inequality would be absolute)

**CS7:** □B  
(Balance at modal depth four is absolute)

**Consistency note:** The axiom set CS1–CS7 is consistent. In Kripke semantics [7] with two accessibility relations R_L and R_R (corresponding to [L] and [R]), there exist frames where depth-two commutation is contingent (satisfying CS3 and CS5) while depth-four commutation is necessary (satisfying CS7). For example, a frame in which R_L and R_R are independent K-relations with R_L ≠ R_R at depth two but R_L ∘ R_R ∘ R_L ∘ R_R = R_R ∘ R_L ∘ R_R ∘ R_L at depth four validates all seven axioms.

## 3.5 Derivation of the Core Theorems

### 3.5.1 Theorem UNA (Unity is Non-Absolute) **[Theorem]**

**Statement:** ⊢ ¬□U

**Proof:**

```
1. ⊢ CS4                               [Axiom: □U → □E]
2. ⊢ CS3                               [Axiom: ¬□E]
3. ⊢ (□U → □E) → (¬□E → ¬□U)           [Lemma: Contraposition]
4. ⊢ ¬□E → ¬□U                         [Modus ponens on lines 1 and 3]
5. ⊢ ¬□U                               [Modus ponens on lines 2 and 4]
```

This theorem formalizes the non-absolute unity introduced in Section 2.2.

**Statement:** ⊢ ¬□O

**Proof:**

```
1. ⊢ CS6                               [Axiom: □O → □¬E]
2. ⊢ CS5                               [Axiom: ¬□¬E]
3. ⊢ (□O → □¬E) → (¬□¬E → ¬□O)         [Lemma: Contraposition]
4. ⊢ ¬□¬E → ¬□O                        [Modus ponens on lines 1 and 3]
5. ⊢ ¬□O                               [Modus ponens on lines 2 and 4]
```

This theorem formalizes the non-absolute opposition introduced in Section 2.3.

### 3.5.3 Theorem BU (Balance is Universal) **[Theorem]**

**Statement:** ⊢ □B

**Proof:**

```
1. ⊢ CS7                               [Axiom: □B]
```

This theorem formalizes the universal balance introduced in Section 2.4.

## 3.6 Logical Structure Summary

The formal system establishes three principal results derived from the seven axioms CS1–CS7: unity is non-absolute (UNA, derived by contraposition from CS3 and CS4), opposition is non-absolute (ONA, derived by contraposition from CS5 and CS6), and balance is universal (BU, directly given by CS7).

Non-absoluteness at modal depth one (unity) prevents homogeneous collapse, while non-absoluteness at modal depth two (opposition) prevents contradictory rigidity. Absoluteness at modal depth four (balance) ensures coherence within the observable horizon. These three properties are logically interdependent through the bridge axioms CS4 and CS6. The asymmetry axioms CS1 and CS2 establish that the left and right transitions are not initially equivalent at the horizon constant.

---

# 4. Gyrogroup-Theoretic Correspondence

## 4.1 Interpretive Framework

The gyrogroup correspondence is necessary, established through uniqueness theorems and explicit constructions **[Derived mapping]**. Theorem 5.1 proves that CS1–CS7 uniquely determine n = 3 spatial dimensions with SU(2) ⋉ R³ structure—alternative dimensionalities violate the modal depth constraints [20]. The GNS construction provides explicit unitary representation on Hilbert space, where modal operators necessarily generate gyration automorphisms through their non-commutative products [23]. Geometric analysis confirms this structure through exact invariants: the π/4 threshold appears in four independent geometric contexts, demonstrating necessity rather than arbitrary choice [30]. Computational verification in `experiments/cgm_Hilbert_Space_analysis.py` and `experiments/cgm_3D_6DoF_analysis.py` confirms these theoretical results numerically.

## 4.2 Gyrogroup Structures

A gyrogroup (G, ⊕) [5,6] is a set G with a binary operation ⊕ satisfying:
1. There exists a left identity: e ⊕ a = a for all a ∈ G
2. For each a ∈ G there exists a left inverse ⊖a such that ⊖a ⊕ a = e
3. For all a, b ∈ G there exists an automorphism gyr[a,b]: G → G such that:
   ```
   a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) = (a ⊕ b) ⊕ gyr[a,b]c
   ```
   (left gyroassociative property)

The gyration operator gyr[a,b] is defined by:
```
gyr[a,b]c = ⊖(a ⊕ b) ⊕ (a ⊕ (b ⊕ c))
```

The automorphism gyr[a,b] preserves the metric structure, acting as an isometry. A bi-gyrogroup possesses both left and right gyroassociative structure, with distinct left and right gyration operators.

## 4.3 Modal-Gyrogroup Correspondence

The modal operators [L] and [R] are gyration operations: [L]φ represents the result of applying left gyration to state φ, while [R]φ represents right gyration. Two-step equality E tests whether [L][R]S ↔ [R][L]S (depth-two commutation), while balance B tests whether [L][R][L][R]S ↔ [R][L][R][L]S (depth-four commutation).

The axiom set CS1–CS7 encodes that two-step gyration around the observable horizon is order-sensitive but not deterministically fixed (CS3, CS5), four-step gyration reaches commutative closure at the observable horizon (CS7), and right gyration acts trivially on the horizon constant while left gyration does not (CS1, CS2).

## 4.4 Operational State Correspondence

The theorems UNA, ONA, and BU correspond to four operational states of gyrogroup structure, all logically necessary, not temporally sequential:

### 4.4.1 State CS (Common Source)

**Axiomatic content:** CS1 and CS2

**Behavior:**
- Right gyration on horizon: rgyr = id
- Left gyration on horizon: lgyr ≠ id

**Structural significance:** The initial asymmetry between left and right gyrations establishes fundamental parity violation at the observable horizon. Only the left gyroassociative property is non-trivial in this operational state.

### 4.4.2 State UNA (Unity is Non-Absolute)

**Theorem:** ⊢ ¬□U

**Behavior:**
- Right gyration: rgyr ≠ id (activated beyond horizon identity)
- Left gyration: lgyr ≠ id (persisting)

**Structural significance:** Both gyrations are now active. The gyrocommutative relation a ⊕ b = gyr[a,b](b ⊕ a) governs observable distinctions rooted in the left-initiated chirality from CS, all within the observable horizon.

### 4.4.3 State ONA (Opposition is Non-Absolute)

**Theorem:** ⊢ ¬□O

**Behavior:**
- Right gyration: rgyr ≠ id
- Left gyration: lgyr ≠ id

**Structural significance:** Both left and right gyroassociative properties operate with maximal non-associativity at modal depth two. The bi-gyrogroup structure is fully active, mediating opposition without absolute contradiction, bounded by the horizon constant.

### 4.4.4 State BU (Balance is Universal)

**Theorem:** ⊢ □B

**Behavior:**
- Right gyration: closes
- Left gyration: closes

**Structural significance:** Both gyrations neutralize at modal depth four, reaching commutative closure. The operation a ⊞ b = a ⊕ gyr[a, ⊖b]b reduces to commutative coaddition, achieving associative closure at the observable horizon. The gyration operators become functionally equivalent to identity while preserving complete structural memory.

## 4.5 Summary of Correspondence

| State | Formal Result | Right Gyration | Left Gyration | Governing Law |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| CS | Axioms CS1–CS2 | id | ≠ id | Left gyroassociativity |
| UNA | ⊢ ¬□U | ≠ id | ≠ id | Gyrocommutativity |
| ONA | ⊢ ¬□O | ≠ id | ≠ id | Bi-gyroassociativity |
| BU | ⊢ □B | achieves closure | achieves closure | Coaddition |

## 4.6 Necessity of Correspondence

The gyrogroup correspondence is established through convergent necessity arguments. Alternative dimensionalities (n = 2, n ≥ 4) violate modal depth constraints, as proven by exhaustive case analysis in Theorem 5.1 [20]. The GNS construction provides explicit unitary representation where modal operators generate gyration automorphisms through mathematical necessity [23]. Geometric invariants confirm this structure: the π/4 threshold appears identically in four independent contexts (circle-square ratios, isoperimetric quotients, lattice packing, gyrotriangle angles), demonstrating geometric necessity rather than arbitrary choice [30]. These three independent lines of argument converge on the same structure, establishing overdetermination through multiple necessities.

---

### 4.7 Structural Convergence in Physical Frameworks

The formal derivation of physical structure from the CGM axioms suggests that the operational states {CS, UNA, ONA, BU} may constitute a necessary logical scaffold. This leads to the hypothesis that successful physical frameworks, developed independently, will exhibit a convergent formal organization mappable to this four-state progression.

**Newtonian Correspondence [Derived Mapping]:** A direct mapping exists between Newton's principles and the CGM operational states. The first principle (inertia) corresponds to **CS**: the axiom CS2 (`¬([L]S ↔ S)`) establishes that a state persists identically under self-action ([R]) but is altered by an external operation ([L]), formalizing the concept of inertia. The second principle (F=ma) corresponds to **UNA**: the activation of both gyrations (`rgyr ≠ id, lgyr ≠ id`) introduces the capacity for dynamic response to interaction, where "force" is modeled by the non-identity of the gyrations. The third principle (action-reaction) corresponds to **ONA**: the bi-gyrogroup structure, with maximal non-associativity at depth two, instantiates a formal reciprocity where every operation induces a compensatory, non-absolute opposition, ensuring conservation.

**Thermodynamic Parallels [Hypothesis]:** The four principles of thermodynamics exhibit structural resonances with the CGM sequence, though the correspondence is less direct than the Newtonian case. The zeroth principle (equilibrium reference) suggests **CS** (foundational commonality as the shared reference frame); the first principle (energy conservation) aligns with **UNA** (distinction without collapse, as energy remains conserved across transformations); the second principle (entropy increase) resonates with **ONA** (directional asymmetry under time reversal, reflecting non-absolute opposition); the third principle (unattainability of absolute zero) parallels **BU** (limiting closure that bounds the system). The tightness of these mappings varies: the zeroth and first principles show stronger structural alignment, while the second principle's connection to ONA is more illustrative than formally derived.

**Structural Convergence Hypothesis [Hypothesis]:** If physical structure is indeed a logical necessity derived from the common governance of observation, then any empirically adequate description of fundamental physical behavior must encode the progression from a foundational asymmetry (CS) through non-absolute distinction (UNA) and regulated opposition (ONA) to coherent closure (BU). The recurrence of this structure in independent frameworks reflects the minimal formal requirements for a coherent, observable universe.

**Formal Claim and Interpretation:** Let F be a physical framework with empirical success comparable to established theories. The hypothesis predicts F will exhibit structural decomposition mappable to the four-state sequence, with varying degrees of directness. The Newtonian case demonstrates tight structural correspondence; thermodynamics shows suggestive parallels. Future work will test this prediction across additional frameworks (general relativity, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics) and formalize criteria for distinguishing tight mappings from illustrative resonances.

**Scope and Falsification:** This is a claim about the formal organization of successful theories, not their specific content. It is falsified if a framework achieves equivalent empirical scope with a fundamentally different, and irreconcilable, formal structure that cannot be mapped to the four-state logic, or if the proposed mappings are shown to be arbitrary upon rigorous formal analysis. The hypothesis is also weakened if all identified mappings remain at the illustrative level without achieving the structural tightness demonstrated in the Newtonian case.

# 5. Geometric Closure and Physical Structure

## 5.1 Angular Thresholds and Gyrotriangle Closure **[Derived mapping]**

The formal theorems UNA, ONA, and BU derived in Section 3 determine precise geometric constraints. Each operational state corresponds to a minimal angle required for its emergence. These parameters are fixed by the gyrotriangle defect formula:

```
δ = π - (α + β + γ)
```

This formula encodes a fundamental observational limit [6]. The value π represents the accessible horizon in phase space. Coherent observation is bounded by π radians, which is half the total phase structure. When the angles sum to exactly π, the system has traversed precisely one observable horizon without defect.

**State CS** establishes the primordial chirality through angle α = π/2, the minimal rotation that distinguishes left from right. The threshold parameter s_p = π/2 encodes this foundational asymmetry.

**State UNA** requires angle β = π/4 for three orthogonal axes to emerge. The threshold u_p = cos(π/4) = 1/√2 measures the equal superposition between perpendicular directions, enabling three-dimensional rotational structure.

**State ONA** adds angle γ = π/4 as the minimal out-of-plane tilt enabling three-dimensional translation. The threshold o_p = π/4 measures this diagonal angle directly. While numerically equal to β, this threshold is conceptually distinct: it captures the tilt out of the UNA plane rather than planar balance.

**State BU** achieves closure. The three angles sum to δ = π - (π/2 + π/4 + π/4) = 0. The vanishing defect corresponds to a complete metric space where all Cauchy sequences converge. The gyrotriangle is degenerate, but this signals completion of a helical path tracing a toroidal surface, not structural collapse. Any further evolution would retrace the same path. A side-parameter form confirms closure at vanishing defect. Details in [21].

## 5.2 Amplitude Closure and the Quantum Gravity Invariant **[Derived mapping]**

The closure at BU requires connecting all accumulated structure to the primordial chirality while respecting the angular ranges of both SU(2) groups. Each SU(2) group carries an angular range of 2π. The amplitude A satisfies the unique dimensionless constraint connecting these ranges to the primordial chirality α:

```
A² × (2π)_L × (2π)_R = α
A² × 4π² = π/2
A² = 1/(8π)
A = 1/(2√(2π)) = m_p
```

**Notation:** m_p denotes the CGM amplitude bound, not the Planck mass.

The amplitude m_p represents the maximum oscillation fitting within one observable horizon. Larger amplitudes would exceed the π radian limit and accumulate defect. The horizon constant S emerges directly from axiom CS7, which requires universal balance at modal depth four; it is a derived quantity following from four-step commutative closure. This invariant equals the complete solid angle 4π. See [21] for complete closure derivation.

## 5.3 Three-Dimensional Necessity **[Theorem]**

The theorems require exactly three spatial dimensions for gyrogroup consistency. See [20] for the complete formal proof.

**From CS:** The asymmetry lgyr ≠ id with rgyr = id yields one degree of freedom, as the chiral seed that uniquely determines all subsequent structure.

**Through UNA:** When right gyration activates (rgyr ≠ id), the constraint gyr[a,b] ∈ Aut(G) comes into force. Consistency with the pre-existing left gyration requires exactly three independent generators, uniquely realized through the isomorphism SU(2) ≅ Spin(3) [12,13], the double cover of SO(3). Fewer dimensions cannot accommodate the full gyroautomorphism group; more dimensions would demand additional generators inconsistent with the single chiral seed from CS.

**Via ONA:** With both gyrations at maximal non-associativity, bi-gyrogroup consistency demands three additional parameters that reconcile the left and right gyroassociative properties. These manifest as three translational degrees of freedom, complementing the three rotational degrees from UNA. The total six-parameter structure (three rotational, three translational) is the minimal bi-gyrogroup completion under the constraints.

**At BU:** The closure condition δ = 0 with angles (π/2, π/4, π/4) is achievable only in three dimensions. The gyrotriangle inequality requires α + β + γ ≤ π in hyperbolic geometry, with equality only for degenerate triangles. Higher-dimensional generalizations cannot satisfy this constraint with the specific angular values required by CS, UNA, and ONA.

The progression 1 → 3 → 6 → 6(closed) degrees of freedom is the unique path satisfying theorems UNA, ONA, and BU while maintaining gyrogroup consistency.

## 5.4 Parity Violation and Time

**Directional asymmetry.** The axiom-level asymmetry encoded in CS1 and CS2 manifests mathematically in the angle sequences. The positive sequence (π/2, π/4, π/4) achieves zero defect, as shown above. The negative sequence (−π/2, −π/4, −π/4) accumulates a 2π defect:

```
δ_- = π - (−π/2 − π/4 − π/4) = 2π
```

The 2π defect represents observation beyond the accessible π-radian horizon. Only the left-gyration-initiated path (positive sequence) provides a defect-free trajectory through phase space. Configurations requiring right gyration to precede left gyration violate the foundational axiom CS and remain structurally unobservable. This explains observed parity violation as an axiomatic property rather than a broken symmetry.

**Time as logical sequence.** Time emerges from proof dependencies: UNA depends on CS3 and CS4, ONA depends on UNA via CS5 and CS6, and BU requires the complete axiom set CS1–CS7. Each theorem preserves the memory of prior proofs through the formal dependency chain. The gyration formula gyr[a,b]c = ⊖(a ⊕ b) ⊕ (a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)) itself encodes operation order, rendering temporal sequence an algebraic property internal to the system. The progression CS → UNA → ONA → BU cannot be reversed without contradiction, since later theorems require earlier results as premises. This logical dependency constitutes the arrow of time, intrinsic to the deductive structure.

## 5.5 Empirical Predictions

The geometric closure yields quantitative values for fundamental constants.

**Assumption ledger.** Anchor-free predictions: K_QG ≈ 3.937 from closure and monodromy (`experiments/cgm_quantum_gravity_analysis.py`), redshift drift forecast ≈ 0 within the stated observational range, aperture ratio δ_BU/m_p = 0.0207 from BU closure (`experiments/cgm_balance_analysis.py`). Anchored to units: E_GUT via Planck and electroweak scales (`experiments/cgm_energy_analysis.py`), neutrino seesaw via E_GUT and 48² quantization (`experiments/cgm_energy_analysis.py`). Fine-structure constant: δ_BU derivation and quartic scaling (`experiments/cgm_alpha_analysis.py`).

**Quantum gravity invariant:** The horizon constant S anchors all subsequent structure **[Theorem]**.

**Fine-structure constant:** From BU dual-pole monodromy through quartic scaling, α = (δ_BU)⁴ / m_p ≈ 1/137.035999206, where δ_BU = 0.195342 rad is the BU dual-pole monodromy, matching experimental precision [17,18] to 0.043 parts per billion **[Hypothesis]**. Uncertainty: ±0.03% from monodromy angle precision and gyrogroup interpretation assumptions. See [19] for complete derivation.

**Neutrino mass scale:** Neutrino masses correspond to minimal excitations of the chiral seed (1 DOF) consistent with three-generational structure (3 DOF). Using 48² quantization, the right-handed neutrino mass scale is M_R = E_GUT/48², and the light neutrino masses follow from the seesaw mechanism [15,16]: m_ν = y²v²/M_R ≈ 0.06 eV (via 48² quantization scheme), consistent with oscillation experiments [14] **[Hypothesis]**. Uncertainty: ±0.02 eV from Yukawa coupling variations and quantization scheme sensitivity. See [22] for complete mechanism.

**Energy scale hierarchy and optical conjugacy:** The operational states generate a hierarchy connected by E^UV × E^IR = (E_CS × E_BU)/(4π²). Anchoring E_CS at the Planck scale (1.22×10¹⁹ GeV) and E_BU at the electroweak scale (246.22 GeV, the Higgs vacuum expectation value v = (√2 G_F)^(-1/2)) [14] yields: E_GUT ≈ 2.34×10¹⁸ GeV, E_UNA ≈ 5.50×10¹⁸ GeV, E_ONA ≈ 6.10×10¹⁸ GeV **[Hypothesis]**. Uncertainty: ±15% from anchor scale variations and geometric dilution factor interpretation. The factor 1/(4π²) represents geometric dilution, explaining the hierarchy problem without fine-tuning. See [22] for complete derivation.

**Cosmological structure:** Cosmological implications follow from UV-IR conjugacy, potentially manifesting as a Planck-scale black hole interior with r_s/R_H = 1.0000 ± 0.0126 (explored in [BH Universe Analysis], with falsifiable predictions like zero redshift drift) **[Hypothesis]**. The coherence radius R_coh = (c/H_0)/4 marks where observations decohere into phase-sliced projections, resolving horizon and flatness problems without inflation.

These values arise from geometric closure conditions (e.g., δ_BU determined by BU monodromy in [19], dimensionality fixed by SU(2) consistency in [20]) with empirical anchors such as Planck and electroweak scales supplying physical units. Predictions that do not depend on external anchors, such as the quantum gravity commutator K_QG ≈ 3.937 or the zero redshift drift forecast, provide independent falsification paths if observed outside the stated bounds. Computational implementations documented in the reproducibility scripts verify these derivations numerically, with propagated uncertainties showing that a ±15% variation in E_GUT induces an approximately ±30% shift in m_ν through the quadratic seesaw dependence while maintaining a low correlation (roughly 0.2) with the fine-structure result.

All emerge from axiom CS through formal derivation.

# 6. Applications and Implications

## 6.1 Information-Theoretic Alignment

The formal structure that generates physical principles through the same logical necessity determines measurable alignment in information and policy systems. The memory of operation order that encodes physical time also supports traceable reasoning: gradient components capture shared structure, cycle components capture differentiation. The aperture A ≈ 0.0207 is the unique balance point that prevents collapse or chaos in both domains, which is why the same closure ratio appears in physical and informational systems.

**Common horizon.** The horizon constant defines the complete space of coherent communication (any informational exchange respecting this bound maintains traceability to common origin). This is the operational meaning of "The Source is Common" in both information and physical systems.

**Operational metrics for AI evaluation [Application].** The theorems provide rigorous quantitative metrics:

**Governance Traceability (from CS):** Does the agent preserve the horizon structure under right operations and alter it under left operations, corresponding to axioms CS1 and CS2? The score is binary: 1 if the agent satisfies both axioms, 0 otherwise. In practice, this measures whether an AI system preserves invariants under commutative operations while allowing controlled variation under non-commutative ones.

**Information Variety (from UNA):** Measured as the fraction of interactions avoiding homogeneity, quantifying preservation of informational diversity within three rotational degrees of freedom.

**Inference Accountability (from ONA):** Measured as the fraction of inferences remaining traceable without absolute contradiction across six degrees of freedom.

**Intelligence Integrity (from BU):** Measured as convergence rate to commutative closure within amplitude bound m_p.

These metrics derive from theorems UNA, ONA, and BU. Aligned systems maintain traceability, preserve variety, ensure accountability, and converge to balance. The Superintelligence Index (SI) is a composite diagnostic score combining these metrics, used in experimental validation only. These metrics operationalize through orthogonal decomposition on a tetrahedral information topology, targeting a 2.07% aperture ratio for balanced alignment (detailed implementation in [Alignment Analysis], including participant protocols and tensegrity dynamics for AI evaluation). They implement CGM's tensegrity dynamics in information space, using the same gyrogroup constraints that set physical balance thresholds. These measurements quantify how CGM geometric necessities (gyrogroup non-associativity, horizon balance) manifest as behavioral properties; deviations highlight the specific structural imbalances predicted by the formal theorems. The 2.07% alignment aperture concerns observational measurement of informational balance and is distinct from the structural closure ratio δ_BU/m_p = 0.0207 governing physical amplitude bounds in Section 5.2. Future research will validate these in empirical AI safety studies. For an end-to-end implementation of CGM principles, see the GyroSI architecture that instantiates a 788,986-state ontology (https://github.com/gyrogovernance/superintelligence; technical specifications in [GyroSI Specs], holographic foundations in [GyroSI Holography]) and the GyroDiagnostics evaluation suite operationalizing the metrics across AI systems (https://github.com/gyrogovernance/gyrodiagnostics).

**Worked Example (Information Variety):** Consider a simple language model generating responses to prompts. The three rotational degrees of freedom map to: (1) semantic diversity (avoiding repetitive token patterns), (2) perspective variation (exploring multiple viewpoints on a topic), (3) structural flexibility (varying sentence constructions and argumentation styles). Measurement: Sample N=1000 model outputs, compute pairwise cosine similarities in embedding space, and calculate the fraction avoiding homogeneity (similarity <0.9). A score of 0.73 indicates 73% of interactions preserve informational diversity, consistent with UNA. Models scoring below 0.5 exhibit homogeneous collapse, violating the non-absolute unity requirement. Full protocol with edge vector decomposition and aperture ratio calculation provided in [Alignment Analysis] and [Measurement Analysis].

**Empirical Validation:** Production evaluations (October 2025) on frontier models demonstrate these metrics detect structural pathologies in operational systems. Analysis of ChatGPT-5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, and Grok-4 revealed 90% deceptive coherence rates in two models despite 71-74% quality scores, proving the metrics capture architectural properties independent of surface performance. Multi-model cross-validation protocols with statistical rigor are documented in [GyroDiagnostics Repository] with complete results and methodologies.

**Cautions.** The aperture target A ≈ 0.0207 serves as a balance guide rather than a hard threshold. Elevated A may reflect evaluator noise rather than genuine instability, while depressed A may indicate over-regularization. Risks include optimizing for the metric instead of the underlying balance and reading semantic meaning into cycle directions; only the magnitude of the residual is intended for interpretation.

**Risks and Mitigations.** Practical deployment risks include over-optimization for metrics rather than underlying balance, and misinterpretation of cycle components as semantic signals. Mitigations: pair CGM metrics with existing evaluations and monitor aperture divergence as an early warning signal for structural imbalance, as implemented in GyroDiagnostics. These considerations follow from the same non-associative properties that prevent absolute unity in physical systems, so metrics should be treated as diagnostic rather than dispositive in decision contexts.

## 6.2 Resolution of Hilbert's Sixth Problem

Hilbert's sixth problem [1] called for the axiomatization of physics. The challenge was to provide a rigorous logical investigation of the axioms underlying physical theory, comparable to the axiomatization achieved in geometry.

CGM advances toward this axiomatization by deriving physical structure from modal logic **[Derived mapping]**. From axioms CS1–CS7, space, time, and physical constants emerge as theorems with explicit derivations (Sections 5.3-5.5). The uniqueness proof shows this derivation is necessary: Theorem 5.1 establishes that only n = 3 spatial dimensions satisfy the modal constraints [20]. The framework constructs a Hilbert-space representation via GNS where the modal operators [L] and [R] generate the algebra of observables, with the horizon constant S defining the normalization (see [23] for complete construction and L²(S²) model). Geometry, dynamics, and quantum structure follow from the requirement that modal operations maintain coherence under recursive closure. This builds on established constructions like GNS representations [29] and Stone's theorem for unitary groups [10] **[Derived mapping]**.

## 6.3 Summary Table and Conclusion

The complete parameter set determined by the formal system:

| State | Theorem | Gyrations (R, L) | DOF | Angle | Threshold | Governing Law |
|-------|---------|------------------|-----|-------|-----------|---------------|
| CS | CS1 through CS7 | id, ≠id | 1 | α = π/2 | s_p = π/2 | Left gyroassociativity |
| UNA | ⊢ ¬□U | ≠id, ≠id | 3 | β = π/4 | u_p = 1/√2 | Gyrocommutativity |
| ONA | ⊢ ¬□O | ≠id, ≠id | 6 | γ = π/4 | o_p = π/4 | Bi-gyroassociativity |
| BU | ⊢ □B | closure | closure | 6 (closed) | δ = 0, m_p = 1/(2√(2π)) | Coaddition |

**Derived constants:** Q_G = 4π, α_fs ≈ 1/137.035999206, E_GUT ≈ 2.34×10¹⁸ GeV, m_ν ≈ 0.06 eV, r_s/R_H ≈ 1

**Conclusion.** Reality emerges as recursion completing its own memory (freedom returning to itself through structured differentiation). From "The Source is Common," formalized as asymmetry between left and right transitions, theorems UNA, ONA, and BU generate space, time, physical scales, and alignment principles. See Section 3 for formal derivations via contraposition and modus ponens. The progression CS → UNA → ONA → BU demonstrates how a single axiomatic foundation can unify physical structure, informational coherence, and alignment principles. This unified structure invites empirical testing across domains, with validation pathways outlined in Sections 6.4-6.6. The framework advances toward completing Hilbert's axiomatization of physics by deriving key structures from a single axiom and defines formal alignment metrics for AI evaluation. Within CGM, physical structure, informational coherence, and governance alignment express the same formal structure: modal transitions achieving operational closure.

## 6.4 Limitations and Future Work

Limitations: Interpretive mappings (e.g., to cosmology in [BH Universe Analysis]) assume gyrogroup validity; discrepancies in predictions (e.g., aperture ratios in [Alignment Analysis]) would require refinement. Future work includes empirical tests of quantum gravity commutator K_QG ≈ 3.937 ([Quantum Gravity Analysis]) and tensegrity-based AI alignment protocols.

**Current status:** All repositories are publicly available for replication and extension. We welcome community contributions, including alternative interpretations of the modal-gyrogroup mapping or extensions to other domains. Peer review through academic channels is encouraged; contact details and contribution guidelines are in the repository.

## 6.5 Validation Roadmap

CGM predictions span multiple timescales and experimental domains:

**Near-term (1-3 years):**
- Independent replication of fine-structure constant calculation [19], verifying δ_BU = 0.195342 rad derivation and quartic scaling.
- Comparison of CMB multipole predictions (ℓ = 37, 74, 111 from harmonic decomposition of CGM angular thresholds, see `experiments/cgm_cmb_data_analysis_*.py`) to Planck satellite data.
- Application of AI metrics (Information Variety, Inference Accountability) to benchmark language models with known alignment properties, establishing baseline scores and correlation with existing safety metrics.
- Numerical verification of gyrotriangle closure (δ = 0) in hyperbolic geometry software.

**Medium-term (5-10 years):**
- Test redshift drift prediction (zero secular change) using Extremely Large Telescope first-light observations (2028+).
- Validate neutrino mass predictions (m_ν ≈ 0.06 ± 0.02 eV) against next-generation oscillation experiments (DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande).
- Measure gravitational wave memory fraction (predicted 2.07% via aperture ratio) with LISA mission (2030s).
- Empirical validation of AI alignment protocols through controlled studies with human-AI interaction datasets.

**Long-term (10+ years):**
- GUT-scale energy tests at future colliders (E_GUT ≈ 2.34×10¹⁸ GeV), probing unification predictions.
- Precision tests of quantum gravity commutator K_QG ≈ 3.937 via tabletop experiments or astrophysical observations.
- Coherence radius verification (R_coh = c/H_0/4) through large-scale structure surveys and gravitational lensing statistics.

Near-term governance use should treat the metrics as diagnostic rather than dispositive. Pair CGM metrics with existing evaluations and monitor divergence as a signal for deeper investigation instead of relying on a single measure for decisions.

## 6.6 Falsifiability Criteria

CGM is falsifiable if the predictions in Section 5.5 deviate beyond stated uncertainties. Specific failure modes include: fine-structure constant beyond ±0.03% [17,18], neutrino masses outside 0.04-0.08 eV [14], spacetime dimensionality differing from 3 [20], quantum gravity invariant Q_G = 4π failing to normalize observables [23], non-zero redshift drift inconsistent with forecast, AI alignment metrics uncorrelated with safety assessments, or energy scale hierarchy contradictions beyond ±15% uncertainty bounds.
