## 🌐 Overview

**Moments: GGG ASI Router** is a deterministic routing kernel that mediates interaction between **Authentic human participants** and **Derivative capabilities** (language models, specialized models, tools, services, compute utilities).

Unlike traditional AI wrappers, it does not just pass messages. It maintains a **compact 48-bit state** that evolves deterministically through lawful transitions, derived from the **Common Governance Model (CGM)** physics.

It defines **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)** as an operational function: **stable, traceable coordination across heterogeneous capabilities at the canonical Superintelligence Aperture equilibrium (A* = 0.0207)**.

---

### 🗝️ Core Function: Regime-Based Routing

Every interaction is a trajectory through a precomputed finite state space (the **GyroSI Atlas**).

1.  **Input:** External input transcribed to introns (256 instruction operators via XOR boundary).
2.  **State:** Lawful transitions advance the 48-bit state.
3.  **Regime:** State maps to one of 256 phenomenological orbits.
4.  **Routing Signature:** Router computes orbit, theta, aperture, SI, and Moments.
5.  **Capability Selection:** Deterministic policy maps signature to target capability.
6.  **Ledger:** Full trajectory logged for replay and Moments accumulation.

This ensures that **governance is structural**: the router enforces traceability, boundedness, and consistency by construction.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: Three-Layer Structure

The router is composed of three layers:

1. **Kernel**: Deterministic physics core with no semantics.
2. **App**: User interface and local orchestration over the kernel.
3. **Plugins**: Domain converters and external integrations.

### The Atlas Maps
Five precomputed maps define the closed operational physics:

| Map | Function |
|-----|----------|
| **Ontology** | Finite set of all lawful 48-bit states. |
| **Epistemology** | Complete transition function: (state, intron) → next state. |
| **Phenomenology** | Maps states to 256 canonical orbit representatives. |
| **Theta (θ)** | Angular divergence from archetypal reference. |
| **Orbit Sizes** | Orbit cardinality (structural specificity signal). |

Each step advances state deterministically through lawful transitions.

## 🚀 Capabilities

- **Deterministic Routing**: Same history always yields same routing decision.
- **Superintelligence Index (SI)**: Measures alignment to canonical aperture (SI = 100 at A* = 0.0207).
- **Moments Accumulation**: Non-semantic alignment units accumulated over cycles, convertible to domain units.
- **Tetrahedral Projection**: Routes via Hodge-decomposed geometry across four CGM stages.
- **Full Auditability**: Complete ledger enables deterministic replay.
- **Hybrid Ready**: Routes to any capability: models, quantum services, tools, or humans.

## 🌐 Theoretical Foundation

The Router is grounded in:

- **Common Governance Model (CGM)** as the constitutional structure of coherent recursive operation.
- **The Human Mark (THM)** as the source-type ontology of Authority and Agency in sociotechnical systems.
- **Gyroscopic Global Governance (GGG)** as the four-domain coupling of Economy, Employment, Education, and Ecology.

The Router operates as a Derivative coordination system: it transforms and routes information but does not originate authority or bear accountability. Accountability terminates in Authentic Agency.

Mathematical formalism uses gyrogroup structures and Hodge decomposition over K4, maintaining parity closure invariance.
