## Domains
---

IMPORTANT: Do not change the labels or ordering of these bracket lines; only change the numbers inside the square brackets.

Domain counts declare how this Program's work is distributed across the three fundamental governance domains. These act as proportional weights for attributing incidents across domains. GGG recommends multi-domain coverage for complete governance loops.

Economy (CGM operations): [1]
Employment (Gyroscope work): [1]
Education (THM capacities): [1]

---
## Unit Specification
---

IMPORTANT: Specify the time unit for incidents. Use "daily" for day-level tracking or "sprint" for sprint-level tracking (sprint = 4x weight).

Unit: [daily]

## COMMON SOURCE CONSENSUS

## ALIGNMENT & DISPLACEMENT BY PRINCIPLE
---

For each principle below, record concrete moments from the program.
An "Alignment Incident" is a case where the principle was upheld in practice.
A "Displacement Incident" is a case where the corresponding risk appeared.
